Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPRESENTATION\nPREPARED BY:\nRebecca Huang, Student - Piedmont Hills High School\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation and Discussion regarding Student Petition from Piedmont Hills High School Requesting to Add English 4 Back to the Master Schedule\n\t \n\t \nThe Early Assessment Program (EAP) is a collaborative effort among three important state entities in California: California State University (CSU), California Department of Education (CDE), and California State Board of Education (SBE). The goal of this unprecedented partnership is to ensure that college bound high-school graduates have the English and mathematics skills expected by the state university. Like most public comprehensive universities, CSU admits students first—and only then tests them to see if they have the reading, writing, and mathematics skills needed for placement in college-level study. If they do not, the students are placed in remedial courses for one or two semesters—thus making the pursuit of a baccalaureate degree more expensive for both the student and the state. \n\t \nThe EAP will allow students, their teachers, their parents, and the CSU to know exactly how well prepared the 11th-graders are for university-level work. Furthermore, it will give high school students a chance to polish their skills before enrolling in college. The EAP has three components: early testing, the opportunity for additional preparation in the 12th grade, and professional development activities for high school English and mathematics teachers. The EAP test is embedded in the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) 11th-grade English Language Arts/Literacy and mathematics. These tests are part of California’s public school testing and accountability system and are required of all grade 11 students. CAASPP exams cover both California high school standards as well as the CSU placement standards. Specified levels of these scores indicate meeting CSU standards. After 11th-graders take the test, they will be notified whether they have either met the CSU expectations (and are thus exempt from any additional CSU placement tests) or whether they need additional preparation in order to be successful in college-level work. \n\t \nThose who need extra work can take the ERWC (Expository Reading and Writing Course) in their Senior year.  In 2003, a task force of a dozen high school teachers and administrators and California State University (CSU) faculty members began developing the Expository Reading and Writing Course (ERWC)--a rigorous, rhetorically based, full-year college preparatory English course for high school seniors designed to support college-readiness in English for California's diverse students. The course was published by The California State University Press (1st edition, 2008; 2nd edition 2013) and has currently been adopted by upwards of 700 comprehensive high schools throughout the state. Notably, the ERWC aligns with the California Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy, addresses critical academic literacy challenges identified by the CSU English Placement Test Committee and ICAS (the Intersegmental Committee of the Academic Senates of the three segments of public higher education in California), and successfully prepares students to meet the academic demands and expectations of college and university faculty.\n\t \nStudents who complete the ERWC course will be better prepared to pass the placement exam to the CSU and may also be exempted from taking the placement exam.\n\t \nThe ERWC course is not an honors course. The course is not a remedial course. It is a college-prep, common core aligned course.\n\t \n\t \nRecommendation:  \nTake the results of the petition back to the English Department Chairs and work with the Subject Area Coordinator to develop a recommendation to IPC (Instructional Program Committee).\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent, and Marisa Hanson, ESTA President\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Adopt Resolution #2015/2016-21 The Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act of 2016 (Prop 30 Extension)\n\t \n\t \nIn 2012, Prop. 30, was passed, which helped public education recover some of the funds it lost during the recession by allowing districts to hire more teachers, faculty and education support professionals; brought additional books and supplies directly to the classroom; reopened school libraries; and improved student access to community college courses, while at the same time helped to stabilize California’s budget. \n\t \nCalifornia continues to lag far behind the rest of the country in education funding, ranking 46th in per-student spending. Governor Brown’s 2016-17 budget forecasts show that unless we extend the tax on the wealthiest Californians, our schools and colleges will come up nearly $5 billion short in the first year, and the state budget will face a nearly $3 billion deficit. \n\t \nThe Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act is not a new tax, but temporarily extends the income tax rates already in place on the wealthiest Californians and only affects the top 2% of earners in the state. The tax increases will automatically expire after 12 years.  The measure is expected to raise $8-11 billion a year that will go directly into a special fund that supports K-12 education and community colleges. \n\t \nAdministration is recommending that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2015/2016-21 The Children's Education and Health Care Protection Act of 2016 (Prop 39 extension).\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt resolution #2015/2016-21 The Children's Education and Health Care Protection Act of 2016 (Prop 30 extension).\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

Overfelt campus.  LPS-SJ is in good standing, and the MOU expires June 30, 2020.\n\t \nLPS-SJ has experienced declining enrollment and in-district ADA.  On that basis, the District has worked collaboratively with LPS to reduce the total facilities to be provided to LPS pursuant to the MOU from 21 classroom buildings and 2 restroom buildings, currently, to 13 classroom buildings and 1 restroom building on the W.C. Overfelt campus and also to reduce the total fees to be paid by LPS to the District for such facilities from $104,659.20 annually to $89,136.00 annually.  The attached Second Amendment to the MOU addresses and memorializes the reduction in facilities and fees payable and is presented for approval by the Board.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nPer Second Amendment as described above. \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees review and approve the proposed Second Amendment to MOU regarding Facilities between ESUHSD and Leadership Public Schools, Inc.  as presented. \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, André Bell, Director of Purchasing and Capital Accounting, Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager, and Carlos Salazar, Senior Projects Manager\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Approve the Project and Award a Contract for Design-Build Services for the Districtwide Fire Alarm Modernization Project\n\t\t \nOn April 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees, pursuant to Education Code §17250.20, adopted Resolution #2014/2015-21 to use the design-build delivery method for the Districtwide Fire Alarm Modernization Project (Item 15.04). \n\t\t \nRequest for Proposals\nThe District developed a Request for Proposals (RFP) to procure design and construction of the Districtwide Fire Alarm Project.  The RFP specified that the following selection criteria were to be considered in selecting the Design-Build Entity (DBE) whose proposal demonstrated the “best value” to the District, as defined in Education Code §17250.15.  The “best value” basis of evaluation allows the District to select a DBE based on more than price alone, one of the advantages of design-build in comparison to traditional delivery methods.  The first five criteria are required by Education Code §17250.15, the code section under which this design-build project is to be awarded.  The additional criteria, which are critical to the success of the project, were added at the District’s discretion.\n\t\t \n                FACTORS                                                                             MAXIMUM POINTS\nPrice                                                                                           20 points\nTechnical Expertise                                                                      5 points\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years                                                  10 points\nSkilled Labor Force Availability                                                  10 points\nAcceptable Safety Record                                                           5 points\nSchedule                                                                                    20 points\nEngineering and Design Innovation                                             5 points\nProject Management Plan                                                           5 points\nProgram Requirements                                                             20 points\n\t\t \n                              TOTAL (Maximum)          100 points\n\t\t \nThe RFP was issued to qualified DBEs. Three DBEs responded to the Project Specific Request for Qualification Process, out of which Two DBEs elected to participate in the design and cost competition set forth in the District’s Request for Proposal published on December 17, 2015. The Request for Proposal included RFP Criteria Documents and Project Scoping information prepared by the District’s Fire Alarm System Consultants, Interface Engineering. On February 3, 2016, the District received proposals from two DBEs:\nAlten Construction, Inc. DBE (“Alten”)\nGonsalves & Stronck Construction Company, Inc. (“G&S”)\n\t\t \nRe-programing and Re-scoping upon Preliminary Review\nUpon performing a preliminary review of the Proposals, the District determined that the Proposal Prices submitted by the two DBEs exceeded the budgeted amounts for design and construction of the project. The Proposal Price consists of the costs for Base Scope, Solicited Alternates, and Unsolicited Alternates. The original Program and Scope of Work were re-evaluated and the District decided to reduce the Base Scope of work and to further delineate Solicited Alternates, at various Districtwide sites, that the District could select based on existing condition of the Fire Alarm System and the priority for modernization. Based on the re-programmed and re-scoped work, the DBEs were requested to submit additional information and clarifications on their Proposals that would enable the District to select the Base Scope and the highest priority Solicited Alternate scope items that could be procured within the available design and construction budget amount. Alten and G&S submitted their revised Proposal information and clarifications on March 3, 2016. \n\t\t \nProposal Evaluation Summary\nThe assessment of District staff, Fire Alarm System consultants Interface Engineering, and construction management staff from Swinerton Management & Consulting, is that while both Proposals, along with the additional information and clarifications, are responsive to the RFP, G&S’s proposal provides the ‘Best Value’ to the District.  The following summarizes the District’s assessment of the nine evaluation factors, which were described in the RFP. \n\t\t \nPrice:  Each Design-Build Entity could earn a maximum of Twenty (20) points in this category. A maximum of nineteen (19) points could be earned by the DBE offering the Best value by designing and constructing the Project as described in the Request for Proposal, including RFP Criteria Documents satisfy all other Design-Build Entity obligations under the Contract Documents. A further maximum of one (1) point could be earned from the value offered in the unsolicited alternates included in the proposal.\n\t\t \nG&S’s proposal offers the Base Scope of work at a substantially lower Proposal Price, thereby allowing the District to select high priority Solicited Alternate scope items at four sites. Notification and Detection Modernization at Andrew Hill, Independence, Silver Creek and Yerba Buena can be achieved as part of the Project scope, thereby providing more value to the District for the available budgeted amounts.  Alten’s proposal offers Base Scope at a comparatively higher Proposal Price, thereby not allowing the District the option of selecting as many Solicited Alternates. G&S received 18 points and Alten received 15 points in this Price category.\n\t\t \nTechnical Expertise: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of Five (5) points in this category based on the qualifications of its team. \n\t\t \nBoth teams proposed experienced teams of project managers, engineers, subcontractors, specialty consultants, and specialty subcontractors to design and construct this project. Alten received 4.38 points and G&S received 4.31 points in this category.\n\t\t \nLife Cycle Costs: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of Ten (10) points in this category, by proposing facilities whose sustainable design results in a low life cycle cost as calculated over a twenty-five (25) year period.  The life cycle cost calculation includes the first cost of the project, annual testing and certification, repair and monitoring costs, and replacement costs of any systems/components whose service lives do not exceed twenty-five (25) years. \n\t\t \nG&S’s proposal provides lower projected Life Cycle Costs, including initial costs, annual costs and replacement costs, compared to Alten.  Alten received 9 points and G&S received 10 points in this category.\n\t\t \nSkilled Labor Force: Each DBE could earn a maximum of Ten (10) points by satisfying the requirements for “skilled labor force availability” as defined in California Education Code Section 17250.10 – 17250.50.  Each was asked to evidence in its Proposal a commitment to furthering these goals:  1) maximizing opportunities for local, small and emerging businesses to compete fairly for work associated with this Project; 2) maximizing opportunities for local workers to be employed on the Project and ensuring adequate staffing for this project given the current competitive market conditions.\n\t\t \nBoth proposals demonstrated commitment to the District’s Project Labor Agreement, requirement for student internships, and commitment to a local workforce. Alten’s proposal included a second Electrical subcontractor, thereby providing additional skilled staff strength.  Alten received 10 points and G&S received 9.50 points in this category.\n\t\t \nAcceptable Safety Record: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of Five (5) points in this category.  Two (2) points could be earned by demonstrating an acceptable safety record.  An additional six (3) points could be earned by submitting a superior Project Safety Plan (PSP), evidencing an exceptionally comprehensive Injury & Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), and having a low Experience Modification Factor rating. \n\t\t \nA key metric of an acceptable safety record is a contractor’s Experience Modification Rate (EMR), which is a measure of the frequency of accidents and injuries that a contractor has incurred on a historical basis.  Both Alten and G&S have EMR better than the industry average of 1.0, but G&S’s average EMR is significantly better and superior to Alten’s.  G&S failed to provide evidence of an IIPP and a Project-specific Safety Plan. Alten received 5 points and G&S received 4.31 points in this category.\n\t\t \nSchedule: Each DBE could earn a maximum of Twenty (20) points by proposing creative scheduling that will reduce the overall length of time of construction, provide most efficient coordination with other CIP projects Districtwide, as well as minimize the impact on the sites as a whole. \n\t\t \nBoth DBEs propose aggressive project schedules that generally meet the requirements of the RFP.  Alten’s proposed scheduled offered more realistic Start Date and meets certain key milestones, compared to G&S’s schedule. Alten received 19.75 points and G&S received 19.00 points in this category.\n\t\t \nEngineering and Design Innovation: Each DBE could earn a maximum of Five (5) points in this category, through the quality of their design solutions as well as the level of innovation reflected in each DBE’s design solution, and its overall approach to constructing the Project. \n\t\t \nAlten and G&S proposes very similar Fire Alarm System configuration and schematic design since they both propose to use the services of the same specialty Fire Alarm subcontractor. Alten received 4.44 points and G&S received 4.50 points in this category.\n\t\t \nProject Management Plan: Each DBE could earn a maximum of Five (5) points by evidencing superiority in their proposed logistics plan, quality assurance/quality control plan, structure of organizational chart, knowledge/skill/ability/experience of key personnel, Owner/DBE interaction strategies, and other aspects of project management. \n\t\t \nBoth Alten and G&S’s proposals include information that conveys their respective Project Management Plans adequately. Alten’s proposal includes the required information such as logistics, owner-DBE interaction, workforce and work hours. G&S proposal offers a superior understanding of the project sites and offers a preliminary logistics plan. Alten received 4.88 points and G&S received 4.38 points in this category.\n\t\t \nProgram Requirements: The Program Requirements were established by the District, in light of other CIP work ongoing and anticipated at Districtwide sites. The Program Requirements were communicated to the DBEs through the RFP, which included the RFP Criteria Documents, Division 00 and 01 Documents, and District’s Design and Construction Standards. Each DBE could earn a maximum of Twenty (20) points by proposing a design that achieves the project’s program requirements as specified in the RFP. \n\t\t \nG&S’s proposal best meets the program requirements by allowing substantially more scope of work, including Base Scope and Solicited Alternates to be performed within the available design-construction budget amount.  Alten’s proposal allows less scope of work to be performed within the available budget. G&S’s proposal provides more value to the Districtwide CIP as it will allow four additional sites to receive FA notification and detection modernization, as high priority Solicited Alternate scope items. This in turn will help support other CIP modernization projects at these sites.  Alten earned 19 points and G&S earned 19.25 points in this category.    \n\t\t \n\t\t \nBased on the proposal evaluation described above, the final score (rounded to two decimal points) for each DBE is as follows:\n\t\t \nSelection Criteria\nMaximum Possible\nPoints\nAlten\nG&S\nPrice\n20\n15.00\n18.00\nTechnical Expertise\n5\n4.38\n4.31\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years\n10\n9.00\n10.00\nSkilled Labor Force Availability\n10\n10.00\n9.50\nAcceptable Safety Record\n5\n5.00\n4.31\nSchedule\n20\n19.75\n19.00\nEngineering and Design Innovation\n5\n4.44\n4.50\nProject Management Plan\n5\n4.88\n4.38\nProgram Requirements\n20\n19.00\n19.25\nTotal\n100\n91.44\n93.25\n\t\t \n\t\t \nBest and Final Proposal Negotiations\nThe RFP specified that following the scoring of each DBE’s proposal, at which time the DBE whose proposal is deemed most responsive to the RFP was determined, and pursuant to Education Code §17250.25(a)(2)(v), the District reserved the right to hold discussions or negotiations with that DBE for the purpose of receiving clarification and/or modification to their proposal, in order to achieve a resulting Best and Final Proposal that could be recommended to the Board of Trustees for contract award.\n\t\t \nG&S’s original proposal offered an efficient solution to the program requirements for the Districtwide Fire Alarm Modernization Project. G&S’s Proposal Price for the Base Scope of work and select high-priority alternates were within the design-construction budget, and provided opportunities for the District to select appropriate and high priority alternates for inclusion into the contract.  \n\t\t \nThe District’s project team, including the construction managers and the Fire Alarm System engineering consultants worked with the District’s Facilities Department to determine which Solicited and Unsolicited Alternates, proposed by G&S, would be procured through the best and final proposal. Solicited Alternates included in the final contract scope of work are 1) Notification and Detection Modernization at Andrew Hill, 2) Notification and Detection Modernization at Independence, 3) Notification and Detection Modernization at Silver Creek, 4) Notification and Detection Modernization at Yerba Buena, 5) Fire Alarm system Testing/Inspection/Preventive Maintenance/Certification, 6) Fire Alarm System Corrective Maintenance, 7) Drafted Auto CADD drawings full and complete in vector file format. The Unsolicited Alternate items listed by G&S did not provide significant value; hence they were not selected. Based on the District’s selection of the Base Scope and the Solicited Alternate scope items, G&S submitted their Best and Final Proposal on March 31, 2016.\n\t\t \nSince the proposed Fire Alarm System Modernization work would be closely interrelated to the ongoing and required Fire Alarm system service, maintenance and certification through the course of the proposed contract and warranty duration, District staff determined that by including the Fire Alarm System service and maintenance as part of the Design-Build contract, the District would receive benefit of a single point of responsibility and receive enhanced coordination during the course of the modernization work. Therefore Solicited Alternate scope of work items 1) Fire Alarm system Testing/Inspection/Preventive Maintenance/Certification and 2) Fire Alarm System Corrective Maintenance are included as part of the Design-Build Contract. The costs for this scope of work shall be funded by Fund 03.\n\t\t \nG&S’s Best and Final Proposal to design and construct the Districtwide Fire Alarm Modernization Project, including Base Scope and Solicited Alternates, is $17,195,678.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nStipend\nA stipend is an amount paid by the owner to those responsive proposers who are unsuccessful in obtaining contract award. A stipend enhances competition to generate market interest in the project from the most highly qualified DBEs, helps defray costly proposal development incurred by DBEs, signals the intent that the owner is serious about carrying the project forward, and encourages proposers to expend the time, money and resources to provide a more creative and comprehensive solution.  The Design-Build Institute of America is an industry organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design-build; this organization recommends the payment of stipends as a best practice.  In the Federal sector, OMB Circular No. A-11 (2006) encourages the use of stipends for reasons described above.\n\t\t \nThe RFP stipulated that if the District awards a Contract for the Project, the District will pay a Stipend in the amount of $5,000 to each non-successful Design-Build Entity that submits a Proposal which is deemed by the District to be responsive and responsible. Alten submitted a responsive and responsible Proposal, and should be awarded the $5,000 Stipend if the District awards a Contract to G&S.\n\t\t \n                                                                                                                               \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n\t\t \nAmount\nFunding Source\nNotes\n$ 14,595,513.00       \nFund 24 Measure I\nFor scope of work related to District wide sites\n$ 1,140,965.00  \nFund 35 School Facilities\nFor scope of work related to Ed Center site\n$ 1,084,200.00\nFund 03\nFor scope of work related to Fire Alarm system Testing/Inspection/Preventive Maintenance/ Certification through the course of this contract\n$ 375,000.00\nFund 03\nFor scope of work related to  Fire Alarm System Corrective Maintenance through the course of this contract\n$17,195,678.00\nTOTAL\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nBased on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees:\nAdopt the above Proposal Evaluation Summary as its findings\nApprove the project and award a design-build contract for the Districtwide Fire Alarm Modernization Project, to Gonsalves & Stronck Construction Company, Inc., in the amount of $17,195,678.00;\nProcess the contract through two Purchase Orders:\nPart of the contract, specifically related to the design and construction of the Fire Alarm Modernization work be processed through a Purchase Order for the amount of $ 15,736,478.00\nPart of this contract, specifically for the scope of work consisting of Fire Alarm system Testing/Inspection/Preventive Maintenance/Certification and Fire Alarm System Corrective Maintenance be processed through a Purchase Order for the amount of $ 1,459,200.00\nApprove payment of the $5,000 stipend to Alten Construction, Inc., DBE for its responsive participation in the design and cost competition\n\t\t \n\t \n",

Since CST can no longer be used as a criterion to reclassify English learners to English proficient students, the California Department of Education directed school districts to select another measure to replace the CST.\n\t \nFor the 2015-2016 school year, three of the four reclassification criteria remain unchanged:\n\t \n1.  Assessment of English language proficiency, using an objective assessment instrument, including but not limited to, the state test of English language development.   \n2. Teacher evaluation, including but not limited to, a review of the student’s curriculum mastery\n3.   Parent opinion and consultation\n\t \nThe fourth criterion requires a comparison of student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills in English-language arts. The assessments results must have an empirically established range of performance in basic skills based on the performance of English proficient students of the same age.\n\t \nSchool districts may identify assessments they will use to determine that English learners are meeting academic measures that indicate they are ready to reclassify. These assessment instruments need to measure basic skills for all students and produce results that show whether a student is performing at or close to grade level. Regulations also specify that local reclassification criteria must be reviewed by the school district committee on programs and services for English learners. \n\t \nA district team convened to review English learners’ reclassification data, assessment instruments, and cut scores that can be used as the academic criterion for reclassification. The proposed criterion was reviewed and recommended based on the guidelines from the California Department of Education.\n\t \n\t \nRequired Criteria\n(California Education Code    Section 313[d])\nDistrict Criteria\nStatus\n1. English Language \n    Proficiency Assessment \nCalifornia English Language \nDevelopment Test (CELDT): Overall proficiency level of 4 or 5, and at least \na 3 in each skill area.\nUnchanged\n2.

F, Modernization Building B Commons, and Building B Demolition and Site Improvement Projects\n\t \nThis written report is in response to the request made by a Board of Trustee Member at the March 3, 2016 board meeting about the criteria for recommending approval of change orders to amend the McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. (MBC) Lease-Leaseback Contracts.  According to the lease-leaseback (LLB) contract there are four major conditions that could generate a change order to the LLB contract.\n\t \nUnforeseen Conditions – Are unanticipated work items required to complete the project that was not discoverable during the curse of design. Typical unforeseen conditions may be discovered while performing underground work and work within the building shell that were different from the original plans.  These items are not visible until they become exposed.\nOwner Listed Anticipated Items – This is for known anticipated scope items, such as repair areas that cannot be fully determined until construction exposes the actual as-is condition.\nAdded Owner Scope – This is for owner added items.\nExtraordinary Design Issues – This is for Architectural/Engineer design error or omissions items that could not be determined during the constructability review process due engineering calculation errors or DSA code compliant issues.\nThe above listed items are considered when reviewing a change order request from the LLB contractor. Listed below are the percentage allocations of the contract amount for these four conditions for each of the three LLB projects at Independence.\n\t \nIH Modernization Performing Arts Center Change Orders No. 1 through 10\n                  Unforeseen Conditions                       1.88%\n                  Owner Allowances                               .29%\n                  Owner Added Scope                          5.74%\n                  Extraordinary Design Error                  .22%\n                  Total percentage\n                  of contract amount                            8.13%\n\t \nIH Modernization Building B Commons Change Order No. 1\n                  Unforeseen Conditions                       .48%\n                  Owner Allowances                            4.82%\n                  Owner Added Scope                         1.40%\n                  Extraordinary Design Error                     0%\n                  Total change percentage\n                  of contract amount                           6.70 %\n\t \nIH Building B Demolition and Site Improvement Change Order No. 1\n                  Unforeseen Conditions                         .82%\n                  Owner Allowances                                   0%\n                  Owner Added Scope                          3.98%\n                  Extraordinary Design Error                   .23%\n                  Total percentage\n                  of contract amount                              5.03%\n\t \nIt should be noted that there are adequate funds available in the project budgets to cover all of these change orders.\n\t \nTo further explain the justification for these change orders, the following are the reasons:\n\t \nIH Modernization Performing Arts Center Change Orders No. 1 through 10\nOwner Added Scope consists of:\nAddition of waste baskets and site benches to allow better gathering areas for students and theater goers\nThe audio visual equipment was intentionally not specified during the design process so that the most current up to date equipment could be installed.\nThis category also included the cost for the changes required by DSA at submission\nModification of lobby soffit and custom sized marker boards to provide a better student experience\nAdditional site paving replacement was needed so to improve the approach the building\nReplacement of controls and valve boxes to ensure proper function of the chiller system\nAdded an energy management systems to better and efficiently control the building\n\t \nIH Modernization Building B Commons Change Order No. 1\nOwner Added Scope consists of:\nThis category included the cost for the changes required by DSA at submission and the addition of white boards and projectors were due to a district standard change shortly after design.\n\t \nIH Building B Demolition and Site Improvement Change Order No. 1\nOwner Added Scope consists of:\nAdditional asphalt replacement at north drive entry at Jackson St. to provide a wider and safer entrance to the campus\nProvide additional enhanced landscaping along the entry points to buildings\nThese listed above are more significant change orders in terms of cost.  During the course of construction the design team which includes the Architect and his Engineers, the Construction Manager, and Facilities staff review every potential change order to confirm the need to recommend for approval.  In general, the criteria used are: life safety and structural concerns, cost, schedule impact, and most important how does it improve and benefit the end users.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nNot applicable\n",

Baseball Coach Bob Leadbetter proposed the idea, and even mocked up a recommended location near the sand volleyball court with painted line markings, bases and pitching mounds.  The field could be dirt, and serve as both softball and baseball infields.  With the closely mown grass and painted markings, the area is already providing additional practice space for concurrent use with the existing two softball and two baseball fields.  The painted mock up demonstrates that a practice infield will fit – a concern voiced by Physical Education (PE) staff.  The mock up also demonstrates that there remains space for new batting cages behind home plate.  There is also space at the east end of the natural turf athletic zone for batting cages.  Independence High School staff will be highly engaged with the design of these new facilities, to ensure that the needs of PE, men’s and women’s athletics are optimized.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nAnother concern voiced at the February 4, Board meeting was that the soccer field layout is not as shown on the presentation.  The graphic showed two side by side soccer fields, parallel to each other and perpendicular to Mabury Avenue.  That layout is the optimized layout designed when the field was renovated in 2013; there are permanent markers at the corners of each field to facilitate repainting of line markings at the beginning of each soccer season.  Last year, one field was marked in differently just for the 2015 soccer season to accommodate storm drainage improvements that were underway.  Those storm drain improvements have been installed, and future soccer field layout will return to the optimized one indicated on the presented graphic.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nIndependence High School Staff Restrooms Near Building K3\nThe availability of staff restrooms near Building K3 Science Classrooms was an articulated concern at the February 4th Board meeting.  The closest staff restroom is in adjacent Building H – the former school administration building; that building is scheduled to be under construction beginning Summer 2016, and the modernized facility will be six classrooms and no restrooms.  Concurrently, new restroom buildings L6 and H2 are in design and will be constructed, with beneficial occupancy scheduled for early November 2016.  The graphic below indicates the designed locations of those new restrooms, which will be comprised of student and staff toilet facilities.  Those new facilities will be reasonably close to the Building K complex, and are intended to serve the occupants in Buildings K, L, G and H at the west end of campus.  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nStaff investigated the possibility of adding a single staff restroom in Building K3.  The addition of a single stall restroom would impede upon program space that was renovated in 2004 (floor plan graphic below).  If encroachment upon program space is acceptable in order to accommodate a restroom, the rough order of magnitude cost is $500,000.  If program space encroachment is unacceptable, a single staff restroom addition outside of the building would cost $600,000.  Site administration does not believe the benefit of a staff restroom in Building K3 justifies the cost, particularly in light of the new Restroom Buildings L6 and H2 that will be available soon.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nIn 2014-15, ACE and DCP charter schools occupied Building H; they are currently no longer occupying Building H.  As of February 2016, Building H is housing McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. – the construction contractor that is modernizing Building B1.  McCarthy was directed to remove their construction trailer in the Theater Plaza upon completion of the Theater modernization project, to relinquish that area of the campus back to school operations.  In lieu of encroaching upon school operations further, the District is housing McCarthy’s project administration staff in Building H.  As of February 29, the staff restroom in Building H is also available for Independence High School staff.  This newly implemented interim mitigation measure is providing access to a staff restroom close to Building K3, until Restroom Buildings L6 and H2 open in November; however, this interim measure will not be available in the Fall 2016 semester, because Building H modernization construction will be underway.\n\t\t\t \nIH Theater Use Policy\nThe theater is available to be rented by both internal and external users.  Reservation can be made using the District’s on line reservation system (http://facilitron.com/esuhsd95133).  The request must be approved by site administration. If theater equipment is needed for the event, it triggers the additional cost of the Light/Sound Technician ($30.00 per hour, minimum of 3 hours).  No students are allowed to operate this equipment without adult supervision.  There may be additional charges depending on additional equipment needed.\n\t\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nFunding Source:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nRecommendation:\nNot applicable\n\t \n",
