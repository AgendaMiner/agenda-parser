A relentless advocate for his students and a concerned colleague for other teachers. Marcelo is passionate about his work as an educator and he is always available for students and colleagues. He is always the first to arrive and the last to leave the school grounds. He tutors many students and is in charge of the immigrant student body. He is available for parents and never misses any school event to show love and support for his students.”  The entire Oak Grove family is proud of Mr. Leal receiving this prestigious, and well-deserved award. \n\t \nCongratulations Mr. Leal! \n",

These schools are being recognized for their exemplary programs that provide at-risk students the environment they need to flourish.\n\t \n\"Continuation high schools serve as an alternative highway for struggling students to complete their high school education and continue on the road to higher learning or out into the workforce,\" Torlakson said.\n\t \nContinuation high schools offer students aged 16 years or older an alternative high school diploma program. While most students who attend continuation high schools do so because they are behind in high school credits, others may be in need of a flexible school schedule because they have jobs outside of school, family needs, or other circumstances.\n\t \nMore than 67,000 students attended the state's 479 continuation high schools in the 2012–13 school year. These alternative programs focus on school-to-career education, individualized instructional strategies, and intensive guidance and counseling.\n\t \nThe Model Continuation High School Recognition Program is a partnership between the California Department of Education (CDE) and the California Continuation Education Association (CCEA). The goal of the partnership is to identify and recognize outstanding programs and creates a resource list of quality programs for school visitations.\n\t \nThere was a total of 27 applicants. Twenty-five applicants were selected to be visited by a review team. During the site visits, the review team interviewed staff, teachers, students, stakeholders, and others familiar with the school. The recurring response from students when asked about what makes their school special was that \"the teachers and staff care about the students.\"\n\t \nSelected schools retain their title for three years. Awardees are eligible to purchase a Model Continuation High School flag to display at their school and will also be recognized in May at the CCEA State Conference in North Hollywood.\n\t \nFor information on continuation education, please visit the CDE Continuation Education Web page.

Contracts Administration Coordinator\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Receive First Reading of New Board Policy #3312.1 Contract Change Orders\n\t\t \n\t\t \nAs a result of the Bond Program Performance Audit, combined with a review of current business practices triggered by the Business Division's strategic plan goals to improve efficiency and customer service, several Board Policies and Administrative Regulations have been assessed and one change to Board Policy is proposed.  The proposed change has been reviewed and is supported by Superintendent's Cabinet, Superintendent's Council, the Board Audit Committee, the District's Senior Manager of Internal Controls, and Legal Counsel.  The proposed change pertains to contract change order authority.\n\t\t \nContract Authority\nThe District’s current approach to contract authority is dictated by the following Board Policies and Administrative Regulations:\n\t\t \n1.  Board Policy #3300 Expenditures and Purchases (May 21, 2009) (Attachment 1) \n\t\t \n“The Superintendent or designee may purchase supplies, materials, apparatus, equipment, and services up to the amounts specified in Public Contract Code 20111, beyond which a competitive bidding process is required. The Board shall not recognize obligations incurred contrary to Board Policy and Administrative Regulations.”  \n\t\t \n2.  Board Policy #3312 Contracts (May 21, 2009) (Attachment 2) \n\t\t \n“Whenever State law invests the Governing Board with the power to enter into contracts on behalf of the District, the Board may, by a majority vote, delegate this power to the Superintendent or designee. To be valid or to constitute an enforceable obligation against the District, all contracts must be approved and/or ratified by the Board. (Education Code 17604)”\n\t\t \nBoard Policy #3300 Expenditures and Purchases, and Board Policy #3312 Contracts state the legal authority and intent to delegate contract authority; yet Administrative Regulation #3311 Bids vested that authority solely with the Board.  As a result, routine business matters were delayed while awaiting the next available Board meeting; there have been occasional after-the-fact contract ratifications by the Board when matters with urgency could not await Board approval; and such delays and/or ratifications are not aligned with the Business Division’s strategic plan goals to improve efficiency and customer service.  Administrative Regulation #3311 Bids has been modified to align with Board Policy #3300 Expenditures and Purchases and Board Policy #3312 Contracts, and is attached for information purposes only (Attachment 3).\n\t\t \nContract Change Orders\nPublic Works Construction Contracts: The District’s historical approach to public works construction change orders has been to embed an owner’s allowance into the original construction contract awarded by the Board.  Over the course of construction, as contract changes were triggered by the revelation of hidden conditions, construction document errors and omissions, and/or owner requested scope changes, Administration authorized contract change orders, drawing down against the owner’s allowance.  If monetary increases to contract scope were projected to exceed the owner’s allowance, Administration requested a contract augmentation by the Board (up to 10% of original contract award for hard bid contracts, per Public Contract Code 20118.4).  Unused owner’s allowance was deducted from the contract via a deductive final change order, which was Board approved.  \n\t\t \nIn the Bond Program Performance Audit conducted by Total School Solutions (TSS) and received by the Board on September 19, 2013 (Board Item 8.04), TSS strongly recommended that the District discontinue the practice of including an allowance in the construction contract, and delegate authority to Administration.  TSS further recommended that delegation and authorization should be done in compliance with Education Code 17604 thru 17606, and that the District should determine the amounts and types of change orders to be approved by designees.  The District ceased the practice of including an owner’s allowance in construction contract awards effective October 2013.\n\t\t \nNon-Public Works Construction Contracts: The District’s historical approach to change orders for contracts other than public works construction is to return to the Board for change order approval.  The delay in awaiting the next available meeting for Board approval of contract change orders often results in a delay to the service/project/initiative under contract.  \n\t\t \nNew Board Policy #3312.1 Contract Change Orders is attached for the Board’s first reading (Attachment 4).  This new policy complements existing Board Policy #3300 Expenditures and Payments and Board Policy #3312 Contracts by providing guidance on the administrative positions authorized to approve contract change orders and the limits of authorization.  An update to the Authorized Signatures list will be triggered upon approval at the second reading of this new Board Policy #3312.1 Contract Change Orders in May.  The associated new Administrative Regulation #3312.1 Contracts Change Orders is attached for information purposes only (Attachment 5).\n\t\t \nThe Board is requested to receive the first reading of new Board Policy #3312.1 Contract Change Orders.    \n\t\t \n\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive the first reading of new Board Policy #3312.1 Contract Change Orders. \n\t \n",
