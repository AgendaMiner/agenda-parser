Overfelt High School PresentationAt W.C. Overfelt High School we are committed to closing the achievement gap by preparing all students to be eligible for college-level work upon graduation from high school. We have made several gains over the last few years and are finding more success with greater numbers of students. Our Board presentation will focus on one of our key strategies, Small Learning Communities. The United States Department of Education defines a Small Learning Community as “an environment in which a core group of teachers and other adults within the school knows the needs, interests, and aspirations of each student well, closely monitors each student’s progress; and provides the academic and other support each student needs to succeed.”  Research has shown that Small Learning Communities increase students’ engagement and connectedness, which results in improved attendance, behavior, and academic achievement. Small Learning Communities at W.C. Overfelt High School generate funds from grants and corporate donations while providing an effective learning environment.",

Through the Federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Federal State Fiscal Stabilization Funds we have been able to offset drastic State Education Funding cuts retaining jobs and continue educating our students.  That having been said the projections for the subsequent years are more than bleak.  The 2009/2010 Second Interim Financial Report projection for next school year 2010/2011, shows the District will be able to meet its financial obligations, but with a reduced State required unrestricted reserve.  In the 2011/2012, school year the projection indicates the District will be short in meeting its financial obligations.  Current State requirements obligate local school boards to certify the financial condition of the school district into one of three conditions, which are:POSITIVE CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district will be able meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years.QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years.NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year or for the remainder of the fiscal year or for the subsequent fiscal year.What the attached 2009/2010 Second Interim Financial Report shows is that the District will be able to meet its financial obligations and reserve requirements for the current fiscal year plus meet the financial obligations, but with a reduced reserve requirement as authorized by the State for the immediate subsequent year.  The report does project that the District may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the 2011/2012, fiscal year.  RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that given the current financial projections the Board of Trustees approve a Qualified Certification of the 2009/2010 Second Interim Financial Report. ",

These services are required to meet the needs of our Special Education students until the District was able to procure new buses.  The District has since received the new buses and is close to having the new buses approved for passenger use by the California Highway Patrol (CHP).  The District is also in the process of having drivers certified and approved to drive the new buses.  The District expects to have the buses and drivers certified by the end of March 2010, which should minimize the use of this vendor in future months.Selection Process The selection process was completed by previous leadership.  The District will do another solicitation process should there be a need to continue with these services in the future.RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees enter into a purchase contract services agreement with Safe Trans Transportation Inc. for the term of July 1, 200, through and including March 31, 2010, for the provision of continued transportation services for Special Education students.2.

This approval is contingent upon the Board authorizing Facilities to move forward with the Calero project as defined in item 10.04.Reason for the Purchase of Outside Services.N/ASelection Process The District completed a formal Request for Qualifications (RFQ), RFQ-02-08-09, which went to the Board for approval of the recommended “Measure E & G Pre-Approved Construction Management Firms (CM) List” on March 10, 2009.  With this list in place, the District then requests from all four of the preapproved to submit a “Construction Management Selection Questionnaire (CMSQ)”, which will include the cost and project team being proposed.  In this case, back on June 9, 2009, Facilities requested CMSQ from three of the four firms.  At that time, Facilities Management Planning and Operations, Inc., was selected to be recommended to the Board for approval.  However, at that time and at subsequent meetings this project was removed from the Board agenda.For this Board meeting, Purchasing requested that new proposals be obtained due to the age of the old proposals and the fact that the hard cost had increased significantly, which would affect the cost proposals previously submitted.  Facilities was able to secure two new proposals, but the third vendor was not able to provide a new proposal given the timeframe in which it is required.
