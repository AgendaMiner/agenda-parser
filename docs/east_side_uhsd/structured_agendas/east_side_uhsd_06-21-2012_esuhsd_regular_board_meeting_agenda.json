This approach considered deferment of $79 Million in scope for the Measure E Bond Program.\n\t\t \nAt its public meeting of March 8, 2012, the Board was informed of options for disposition of the remaining $79 Million in voter approved authorization by Bond Advisor, Dale Scott & Company. It is in this context that the Board requested staff to compile a list of projects that would not be completed if no further funding were made available under Measure E.\n\t\t \nIn 2007 - 2008 a priority list of projects, reflective of total need at that time, was systematically developed by staff, sites, and cabinet. This list was considered and approved in counterpart by the Board of Trustees, starting in February, 2009 and concluding in October, 2009.  Completion of the entire list was subject to availability of funds. After the completion of Phases I, II, and a limited Phase III of the Measure E Program, approximately $190 Million in projects identified on the priority list would remain unfunded. This list of unfunded projects was reviewed by the Board at the public meeting of April 19, 2012.\n\t\t \nAlternative scenarios are available, subject to the Board’s discretion, to move forward to address scope needs ranging from $79 - $190 Million, based on the list of “Unfunded Projects”.  Inasmuch as specific projects, as previously enumerated, were defined as early as 2007, many of these projects must be revalidated through a process involving school sites, administration, and the Board before subsequent planning and construction can take place. This revalidation process will commence upon the action of the Board to proceed with plans to further fund the Capital Construction Program at East Side.\n\t\t \nDuring the meeting of April 19, 2012, the Board also began to examine options that would help to ensure continuity of the District’s capital construction program. Staff was directed to provide further information on both the potential projects as well as options for funding these projects. Accordingly, staff has prepared a review of projects, attached. Options for funding will be the subject of a separate presentation, which follows.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees\n\t \n",

The Board has been presented with two funding alternatives to address these needs.  Alternative A would seek voter approval to reauthorize $78 million of the 2008 Measure E GO bonds. These bonds cannot be sold today at a reasonable cost due to Proposition 39 tax rate limitations.  An additional ballot measure would be needed in 2016 to generate the remaining required funding. Alternative B would place a $120 million new money GO bond on the November 2012 ballot.  After these funds are expended, the remaining Measure E bonds would be issued once assessed valuations have risen.  Agenda item 11.04 provides alternative resolutions for these two options. An analysis by the District’s financial advisor has calculated the difference in the cost to taxpayers between these two alternatives to be negligible.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTo be determined\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nTo be determined\n\t\t \n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the passage of the Alternative B resolution calling for a $120 new bond measure to be placed on the November 2012 ballot.\n\t \n",

For ESUHSD, the take-back would represent an estimated $10 million per year.  The district would have sufficient reserves in FY 2012-13 in the event of a take-back, however, the district’s remaining reserves would be depleted by FY 2014-15.  The district has prepared a contingency plan which would require reductions of $6.6 million in FY 2012-13, $16.6 million in FY 13-14, and $16.7 million in FY 14-15. This scenario would be catastrophic for ESUHSD and all K-12 education.  We will continue to monitor and report on the State’s budget circumstances and how it impacts the district as information becomes available.         \n\t\t \nThe attached budget book with executive summary provides a more detailed analysis of the FY 2012-13 district budget and required State SACS reporting forms.  \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and adopt the annual budget for 2012/2013.\n\t \n",
