Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nJuan Cruz, Assistant Superintendent of Instructional Services\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action on Charter Petition for Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School\n\t \nBrief Introduction and Summary of Recommendation\nOn April 1, 2014, Will Eden, Entrepreneur in Residence, Alpha Public Schools, submitted a petition (“Petition”) dated March 27, 2014, to establish the Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School, a ninth through twelfth grade high school with a projected enrollment of 607 students, in the Alum Rock community of the East Side Union High School District. The Petition was received by the Board of Trustees on April 17, 2014. \n\t \nCalifornia Education Code § 47605 (b) requires that “no later than 30 days after receiving a petition… the governing board of the school district shall hold a public hearing on the provision of the charter at which time the governing board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district, and parents.”  The Education Code further requires that the “governing board of the school district shall either grant or deny the charter within 60 days of receipt of the petition.” The date for the governing board’s decision “may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension.” The June 19th regularly scheduled meeting of the East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) occurs four days after the 60-day deadline.  Alpha Public Schools agreed to a four-day extension for the Board’s decision. \n\t \nThe Board held a public hearing on the Alpha: Cindy Avitia Charter Petition on May 15, 2014, at 7:00 p.m. during the Regular Board Meeting. The petitioner, Will Eden, spoke on behalf of the charter school. Pursuant to Section 47605, the Board, following review of the Petition and public hearing, shall either grant or deny the charter petition. The Board will make a decision about whether to grant or deny the Petition at its meeting on June 19, 2014.  \n\t \nThe mission of the charter school as stated in the petition on p. 14 is: “to provide children from high-poverty communities an education that effectively develops the academic skills and competencies of character to overcome the achievement gap, graduate from college, and become self-reliant and productive leaders.” To achieve that mission, the charter school proposes to: “provide the rigor, structure, and support needed to guide students to academic success.  Alpha will provide an excellent educational program that rests on best practices, quality professional development, and an instructional framework that allows for a strong match between learning needs and teaching methods through differentiation ”(p. 14). \nStandards for Review/Denial/Authorization\nEducation Code section 47605 establishes the requirements a petitioner must satisfy in order for his petition for the charter school to be approved.  Education Code section 47605 (b) provides that  the governing board of a school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one of more of the following findings:\nThe charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\nThe petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\nThe petition does not contain the number of parent or teacher signatures required by Education Code section 47605 (A)-(B).\nThe petition does not contain an affirmation that the charter school “shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against any pupil on the  basis” pursuant to [Education Code] Section 220 of “disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from state financial assistance….”\nThe petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\n(i) A description of the educational program of the school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the school is attempting to education, what it means to be an “educated person” in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\n(ii) If the proposed school will served high school pupils, a description of the manner in which the charter school will inform parents about the transferability of courses to other public high schools and the eligibility of courses to meet college entrance requirements. Courses offered by the charter school that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges may be considered transferable and courses approved by the University of California or the California State University as creditable under the “A” to “G” admissions criteria may be considered to meet college entrance requirements.\nThe measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school.  \nThe method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured.\nThe governance structure of the school including, but not limited to, the process to be followed by the school to ensure parental involvement.\n The qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the school.\n The procedures that the school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. These procedures shall include the requirement that each employee of the school furnish the school with a criminal record summary as described in Section 44237.\nThe means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted.\nAdmission requirements, if applicable.\nThe manner in which annual, independent financial audits shall be conducted, which shall employ generally accepted accounting principles, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the chartering authority.\nThe procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled.\nThe manner by which staff members of the charter schools will be covered by the State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or federal social security.\nThe public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the school district who choose not to attend charter schools.\n A description of the rights of any employee of the school district upon leaving the employment of the school district to work in a charter school, and of any rights of return to the school district after employment at a charter school.\nThe procedures to be followed by the charter school and the entity granting the charter to resolve disputes relating to provision of the charter.\nA declaration whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public school employer of the charter school for purposes of the Educational Employment Relations Act. \nA description of the procedures to be used if the charter school closes. The procedures shall ensure a final audit of the school to determine the disposition of all assets and liabilities of the charter school, including plans for disposing of any net assets and for the maintenance and transfer of pupil records.  \nReview of the Petition \nStaff reviewed the Petition for Alpha: Cindy Avitia Charter School utilizing the criteria for charter approval set forth in the California Educational Code Section 47605.  Staff’s assessment of the information provided in the Petition with respect to each of the criterion in Education Code Section 47605 is set forth below and on the attached East Side Union High School District Staff Charter School Review Matrix.  Page number references are to the Alpha: Cindy Avitia Charter Petition provided to the East Side Union High School District on April 1, 2014, and received by the Board on April 17, 2014. \n\t \nRequired Signatures\nA charter petition must be signed by either (1) a number of parents/guardians equivalent to at least one-half of the number of students that the charter school estimates will enroll in the charter school for its first year of operation; or (2) a number of teachers equivalent to at least one-half the number of teachers that the charter school estimates will be employed at the school during its first year of operation.  Education Code section 47605 (l) provides that\n\t[t]eachers in charter school shall be required to hold a Commission on Teacher Credentialing certificate, permit, or other document equivalent to that which a teacher in other public school would be required to hold…. It is the intent of the Legislature that charter schools be given flexibility with regard to noncore, noncollege preparatory courses.’\n\t \nThe Petition was signed by 184 parents or legal guardians, who by signing the Petition “certify that they are meaningfully interested in having [their] child or ward attend the charter school….” Staff concludes that the Petition contains the required number of parent signatures.\n\t \nRequired Elements and Findings in Accordance with Education Code Section 47605(b)\nEducational Program   \n       Staff finds that the Petition contains a sufficient description of the educational program.\n\t \nAbility to Successfully Implement the  Program Set Forth in the Petition\nStaff finds no facts to demonstrate the petitioner is unlikely to successfully implement the program.\n\t \nRequired Parent or Teacher Signatures\n       Staff finds that this requirement was met.\n\t \nRequired Affirmations\n       Staff finds that the petition contains all of the required affirmations.\n\t \nComprehensive Descriptions\nStaff finds that the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements, except the following:\nDescription of the Educational Program listed in the section above at A (i)\nStaff finds that the Petition contains insufficient information regarding:\nEnglish Language Arts\nThe scope and sequence for the 9th and 10th grade Common Core English Language Arts State Standards\nThe rationale for placement of students in either a traditional or an advanced placement English course\nSocial Studies/World Languages/Electives\nInformation regarding how the California Common Core State Standards for Literacy in History/ Social Science will be incorporated into social science instruction\nMathematics\nThe Common Core Mathematics State Standards and the eight Mathematical Practice Standards\nA plan to offer Advanced Placement Calculus and Non-Advanced Placement Calculus that would not negatively affect students who enroll in the Non-Advanced Placement courses based on the UC Doorways practices\nScience\nThe Next Generation Science Standards and the incorporation of the California Common Core State Standards for Literacy in Science\nCore Courses\nCore cores defined by Education Code under the UC A-G requirements and No Child Left Behind (NCLB)\nEnglish Language Learners\nAlternative assessments for the reclassification of English Language Learners during the interim period when the California Standards Tests (CSTs) are no longer available for use\nExpected Instructional Materials\nInstructional  materials need to be updated to include the Common Core State Standards across the curriculum\nMeasureable Pupil Outcomes listed in the section above at B:\nPhysical Fitness Testing, required by law (Education Code section 60800) for ninth graders\nMisidentification of the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) as an instrument to measure college readiness\nPlanned use of the Partnership for Assessment of  Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) Assessment rather than the Smarter Balanced Assessment which supports the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP)\nGraduation Requirements listed in the section above as (ii):\nClear delineation of graduation requirements, course units and the total units needed for graduation\nA plan for Special Education students who experience difficulty in meeting the rigorous graduation standards\nGraduation requirements that far exceed those of most high schools that potentially could disadvantage students who chose to attend Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School by not awarding a diploma\nService Credit listed in the section above at M:\nClarification regarding whether staff will continue to earn service credit (tenure) in the district while employed at the charter school\nClosure Procedures listed in the section above at P:\nThe closure procedure information was incomplete.\nFinancial Plan\nStaff determined that the financial plan is sufficient and requested to have clarified, the source of the revenue for uniforms listed under local revenue\nAdministration’s Recommended Conditions of Approval\nThe District Administration recognizes that the Alpha’s stated mission is achievable and, if successfully implemented, would serve an important need and provide an important benefit to the community.  Alpha Public Schools has operated Alpha: Blanca Alvarado Middle School in the Alum Rock community for two years. In its first year of operation, Alpha: Blanca Alvarado Middle School earned “an API of 828 as a school. This included a Latino API of 814” (p. 9).  \n\t \nOn May 7, 2014, the District Charter Review Team visited Alpha: Blanca Alvarado Middle School to learn more about the curricular model. They visited classrooms to observe the instructional program, met with parents, teachers, administration, Alpha Board members and students.  Subsequent to the Alpha: Blanca Alvarado Middle School site visit, on May 27, 2014, the District Charter Review Team held a meeting with Alpha petitioners to review deficiencies in the charter petition, answer clarifying questions and  discuss the revisions needed to meet the conditions stated below. The District Charter Review Team is committed to working with the petitioners to ensure a satisfactory charter petition.\n\t \nNotwithstanding Alpha Public Schools’ work at the middle school, the District Administration has concerns about the broad descriptions of the education program, presented in the charter petition that do not adequately convey an understanding of the Common Core State Standards in several curricula areas. For the aforementioned and proceeding reasons described in detail in Section III above, the Administration recommends conditionally approving the Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School charter with the conditions stated in this memo.\n\t \nCondition #1:  Petition Deficiencies \n\t \nCorrect the deficiencies in the charter petition noted in the East Side Union High School District Charter School Review Matrix evaluation, submitted to the Board during these authorization proceedings, by no later than September 25, 2014. The deficiencies are delineated above in Section III.\n\t \nCondition #2: Memorandum of Understanding\n\t \nAlpha Public Schools must successfully negotiate an acceptable Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with the District no later than September 25, 2014.     \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION: \nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees review and consider the proposed Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School charter petition submitted by Petitioner, Will Eden, Alpha Public Schools. If the Board determines to authorize the charter conditionally based on the satisfactory submission and resolution of the conditions stated above by the dates indicated above, then Administration proposes and recommends that the Board adopt the above analysis and factual findings in support of its conditional approval.  On that basis, Administration recommends authorizing the charter petition based on satisfaction of Conditions 1-2 above as described herein and that the Petition be approved solely on that basis for a term of 5 years, commencing on July 1, 2015, to end on June 30, 2020. It is further recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the District administration to sign off on the conditions of approval for the Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School charter petition once the petitioners have satisfactorily met the specified conditions.\n\t \n",

Code 66000 et seq.), updated by the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act of 1998 (Ed. Code 17620), permits school districts to charge developers a fee for new construction and reconstruction on residential, commercial and industrial projects.  These fees are commonly referred to as developer fees.  Biannually, the State increases the amount of fees schools can levy based on a revised State formula.  In January 2014, the State Allocation Board approved an increase that adjusted the developer fees for commercial and industrial to $0.54, and for residential to $3.36 per square foot.\n\t \nIn order to increase the fee it levies upon development, the District must document that an increase is warranted, publish a notice of public hearing, hold a public hearing, adopt a resolution regarding school facility/developer fees, and notify the City of San Jose and Santa Clara County of the adopted resolution.\n\t \nAttached is Board Resolution #2013/2014-29 that sets forth the continued justification that would permit the District to collect developer fees up to the maximum allowed by law.  In addition, attached is the Developer Fee Study dated June 2014, which justifies collection of the increased fee.  The Study documents an analysis of existing facilities inventory, existing student capacity, enrollment projections, construction costs, average high school size and average new home size.\n\t \nThe District entered into an Agreement with its feeder districts on January 22, 1987, to allocate 33.33% of allowable developer fees to East Side Union High School District and 66.66% to feeder school districts.  As such, with the Board’s adoption of Resolution #2013/2014-29, the District’s developer fee levy would be modified as follows and would become effective August 19, 2014: \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nDevelopment Type\nESUHSD Developer Fee\nCurrent\n(per square foot)\nESUHSD Developer Fee\nEffective August 19, 2014\n(per square foot)\nResidential\n$0.99\n$1.12\nCommercial/Industrial\n$0.16\n$0.18\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nNot Applicable                                                   \n                                                                                               \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2013/2014-29 Increase in School Developer Fees.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nJuan Cruz, Assistant Superintendent of Instructional Services\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Approve The NHU Foundation's Request for Material Revision to the Latino College Preparatory Academy Charter Petition\n\t \nBrief Introduction and Summary of Recommendation\nOn March 24, 2011, the East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) approved the charter renewal petition for Latino College Preparatory Academy (LCPA), granting The NHU Foundation permission to operate LCPA within the boundaries of the East Side Union High School District, located in San Jose, California. The Board granted The NHU Foundation for LCPA, a term of five years, from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016. This was the second renewal for LCPA which was first approved by the Board on January 29, 2001. The East Side Union High School District (District) received the charter renewal petition on December 31, 2010, and held a public hearing on February 17, 2011. \n\t \nOn June 4, 2014, the East Side Union High School District received a letter (Attachment A) from The NHU Foundation informing the District of its intention to move LCPA from its current location on the Mount Pleasant District campus at 1966 Flint Avenue, San Jose, California, to the National Hispanic University, located at 14271 Story Road, San Jose, California. The change in location constitutes a material change to the charter petition and is consistent with a request for a material revision. From its inception or founding to June 30, 2011, The NHU Foundation operated LCPA on the National Hispanic University campus in buildings separate from the National Hispanic University. The NHU Foundation has operated LCPA on the Mount Pleasant site since July 2011.  \n\t \nDuring a monitoring visit to the LCPA campus in May, ESUHSD staff was notified informally, regarding the NHU Foundation’s plan to return to the National Hispanic University campus effective July 1, 2014. Furthermore, NHU staff informed District staff that at minimum, two other tenants, Santa Clara University and National Hispanic University, will occupy and conduct their programs, in various portions of the same building in which The NHU Foundation plans to house LCPA. NHU staff have made clear to ESUHSD staff that Santa Clara University’s use of the facility will be limited to evenings and National Hispanic University’s remaining students’ involvement will be mainly online. Attachment B contains a schematic that illustrates how and where NHU plans to allocate space for LCPA.  \n\t \nDistrict staff visited the proposed school site at National Hispanic University and have found it to be satisfactory or adequate for a school of approximately 400 students and will service their program. \n\t \nCurrent Location of LCPA\n\t \nThe location of the school facility is referenced on page 31 of the Latino College Preparatory Academy Charter Renewal Petition submitted to the East Side Union High School District on January 1, 2011, and approved on March 24, 2011 (Attachment C).\n\t \nThe school has been located at 14271 Story Road since it was founded.  Due to the short term remaining on its lease and the deteriorating condition of the present campus, the school must now relocate. For this purpose the Foundation has leased a school site from the Mt. Pleasant School District, located approximately 10 minutes from its current campus. The Foundations Charter School Committee and staff will work with faculty and parents to accomplish a successful transition. The scheduled date for the move is July 1, 2011.\n\t \nProposed Change to the Location of LCPA\n\t \nThe NHU Foundation proposes to move LCPA to the National Hispanic University facility located at 14271 Story Road, San Jose, California (Attachment D). \n\t \nIn order to give Latino College Preparatory Academy (LCPA) a permanent home, the school administration and Charter School Committee are working to move the campus from Ida Jew Academies in Mt. Pleasant Elementary School District to its original home at 14271 Story Road for the 2014-2015 academic year. All stakeholders will be engaged in the facilities move process and the NHU Foundation will be supporting the school staff with the resources at its disposal.  The move will occur over the course of the summer of 2014. \nStandard for Review/Denial Authorization\nPursuant to Education Code § 47607 (a) (1), the Board must consider whether to approve the material revision. Education Code § 47607 (a) (2) requires that “material revisions of charters” are to “be governed by the standards and criteria in Section 47605.” Therefore, if the Board should decide to deny NHU’s material revision request for LCPA, then the Board must make “written factual findings,” specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings: \nThe charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\nThe petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\nThe petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).\nThe petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (d). \nThe petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the required elements.\nFindings #1, #3, #4 and #5 would not be applicable.  If the Board decides to deny the request to relocate LCPA from its current site on the Mt. Pleasant Elementary School campus to National Hispanic University, it must make “written factual findings” with respect to Finding #2.  However, staff found that the facility LCPA will occupy and will allow the NHU Foundation to implement the program specified in the LCPA charter petition.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe Administration recommends that the Board approve the material revision request to the Latino College Preparatory charter petition to permit The NHU Foundation to change the location of the school effective July 1, 2014. \n",

The Governor's May Revision State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) recommendation and re-calibration of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Gap percentages represent a loss of over $11 million in revenues.  The loss of revenues come at a time when the District is trying to implement the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) and restore critical services and programs.  The District will revisit these items once the final State budget is adopted to determine short and long-term implications for budgetary planning. \n\t\t \nThe District may consider submitting a 45-day budget revision to the adopted budget depending upon the results of the State’s final budget adoption actions.  The District will still need to be vigilant in managing deficit spending and will need to closely monitor future spending to ensure spending is balanced. The District will continue to closely monitor and report on the State’s budget circumstances and how it impacts the District as information becomes available.         \n\t\t \nThe 2014-15 budget indicates that the District is recommending that a positive budget be adopted based on the District’s ability to maintain sufficient reserves for the upcoming and two subsequent fiscal years.

The Act requires public entities like East Side Union High School District to qualify architectural firms prior to retaining them for professional services.  The District requires architectural firms to meet the following criteria:\n\t \nCalifornia licensing or registry (for architects and engineers)\nSuccessful experience with the Division of the State Architect\nSuccessful experience on educational projects, particularly K-12\nSuccessful experience in projects similar to the District’s renovation and new construction projects\nRecord of responsiveness\nAcceptable business practices, such as discipline coordination, cost estimating, cost management, quality control, project team communications, dispute resolution, etc.\nResumes of key personnel\nLitigation history\nCompetitive fee schedule\n\t \nBackground:\nThe District released a Request for Qualifications for Architectural Services on December 19, 2013 (RFQ-08-13-14). \n\t \nNineteen (19) Statements of Qualification (SOQ) were received on January 24, 2014. Based on the evaluation and at the March 20, 2014, Board meeting, the Board of Trustees approved staff’s recommendation to approve all nineteen firms to be added to the existing pool of architects for the construction program.  \n\t \nIt is in the District’s best interest to allow interested architectural firms to join the pool over time and to actively expand the pool to also include firms who provide design services in engineering disciplines (structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, etc.), as well as other types of professional service providers whose services are critical to a successful construction program (e.g., commissioning).  Administration will bring forth to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis (as needed) recommendations to add qualified professional service providers to the pool.\n\t \nAdministration has received two (2) Statements of Qualifications (SOQ) to be included in the pool of architects.  The design firms are Sally Swanson Architects, Inc., and Dreiling Terrones Architecture, Inc. (DTA).  The firm's SOQ’s went through the screening process.  Both firms' scores qualified them to be included in the pool.\n\t \n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the additions of Sally Swanson Architects, Inc., and Dreiling Terrones Architecture, Inc., (DTA) to the pool of firms qualified to provide architectural services.\n",

[Section 1114(a)(1) of Title I of ESEA].\n\t \nWhereas Title I targeted assistance programs only provide educational services to identified individual students, school wide programs allow staff in schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families  to redesign their entire educational program to serve all students. The emphasis in school wide program schools is on serving all students, improving all structures that support student learning, and combining all resources, as allowed, to achieve a common goal. School wide programs maximize the impact of Title I. Adopting this strategy should result in an ongoing, comprehensive plan for school improvement that is owned by the entire school community and tailored to its unique needs.  \n\t \nCalero High School Qualifies for School Wide Program Status based on all required elements:\n\t \nA school operating a school wide program must conduct a comprehensive needs assessment that identifies the school's strengths and challenges in key areas that affect student achievement [Section 1114(b) (1) (A) Title I of ESEA].\nThe school must develop a comprehensive school wide plan that describes how it will achieve the goals it has identified as a result of its needs assessment [Section 1114(b)(I)(B-J) and 34 CFR 200.27) of Title I of ESEA].  The school wide plan must:\nIdentify reform strategies, aligned with the needs assessment, that are research based and provide opportunities for all children to meet the State's proficient or advanced level of academic achievement\nProvide instruction by highly qualified teachers\nOffer high quality, ongoing professional development\nCreate strategies to attract highly qualified teachers\nCreate strategies to increase parental involvement\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the application for Title I School Wide Program for Calero High School.\n\t \n\t \n",
