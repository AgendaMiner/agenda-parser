Moreover, more than 40,000 educators have been laid off from California public schools since 2008, impacting the quality of the educational programs delivered to students; and\n\t \nWHEREAS, East Side Union High School District has implemented the following cuts in order to stay fiscally solvent: $51,273,000; and \n\t \nWHEREAS, the school funding crisis is at historic proportions with 188 school districts certifying possible difficulty in meeting their financial obligations over the next two years; and\n\t \nWHEREAS, the 2012-13 state budget is predicated on voter approval in November 2012 of the Schools & Local Public Safety Protection Act (Prop 30), without which schools will receive additional mid-year funding reductions that will result in additional cuts in services and programs to students; and \n\t \nWHEREAS, Proposition 30 and Proposition 38 will direct billions of dollars to public schools, providing an important short-term funding solution that may allow for the restoration of some student programs and services; and \n\t \nWHEREAS, the California School Boards Association, representing nearly 1,000 school district governing boards and regional educational agencies, supports the passage of both Proposition 30 (Schools & Local Public Safety Protection Act) and Proposition 38 (Our Children Our Future: Local Schools and Early Education Investment Act); and\n\t \nBE IT RESOLVED that the East Side Union High School District Governing Board joins CSBA and school districts around the state in supporting both funding measures and proudly joins the Stand Up For Education campaign to urge the Legislature to work with CSBA and other education leaders to identify long-term adequate funding solutions for public schools; and\n\t \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this body, the East Side Union High School District, supports the passage of both Proposition 30 and Proposition 38 because each provides needed revenue to public schools. \n\t \nPASSED AND ADOPTED this 23rd day of August 2012 by the Governing Board of the East Side Union High School District at its regular meeting held at 830 N.

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Rogelio Ruiz, Legal Counsel, Rehon & Roberts\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nStatus of Piedmont Hills High School Auxiliary Gym Project; Approval of Termination of Contract with BCI Builders, Inc. for Construction of Project and/or Termination of Contractor's Right to Perform the Work of the Contract; Delegation of Authority to Administration to Terminate Contract and/or Contractor's Right to Perform the Work of the Contract and to Tender Claim to Surety Under Project Performance Bond\n\t \n\t \n\t \nProject Background and Status\n\t\t \nOn April 21, 2011, the Board took action to award the above construction project contract to BCI Builders, Inc. (\"BCI\") in the original contract amount of $3,860,000.00. In connection with the contract BCI posted a Performance Bond in favor of the District for the full contract amount.\n\t\t \nA Notice to Proceed was issued to BCI on May 5, 2011.  At the time, the total contract time was estimated to be 425 calendar days with an estimated completion date of July 7, 2012.  That completion date has since passed and BCI has fallen substantially behind schedule on the project.\n\t\t \nThe project has run into numerous difficulties:\n\t\t \nSeveral subcontractors have issued stop notices due to BCI's failure to pay, which currently include Arming-Johnson in the amount of $101,168.00 (Attachment 5), and J.L. Shumaker Co. in the amount of$167,319.80 (Attachment 6).\nSome subcontractors have not returned to continue critical path work.\nThe project remains off-schedule and no realistic recovery schedule is in place or has been proposed by BCI.\nThere is an inadequate level of manpower on the project and at the site to complete the project within a reasonable amount of time.\n\t\t \nDistrict staff and the District's Construction Manager have met with BCI to discuss project progress and to allow BCI an opportunity to remedy the delays or, alternatively, to provide a feasible plan for remedying the delays and completing the project within a reasonable amount of time.  District staff met with BCI on July 25, 2012, to discuss the gravity of the matter and to discuss BCI's development of a feasible plan for completing the project.  At that time BCI was asked to submit to the District no later than August 6 a plan to finance the completion of the project, a new critical path method (CPM) schedule for the project showing the actual date that the project will finish.  A copy of a July 25, 2012, follow-up letter from the District's Construction Manager (O'Connor Construction Management) to BCI is included as Attachment 1 and which details inadequate manpower and staffing levels at the project site.  BCI subsequently provided a recovery schedule (Attachment 2) showing projected beneficial occupancy by the District on January 17, 2013.  BCI has not provided the requested financial plan.\n\t\t \nThe District's Construction Manager has had subsequent communications with BCI regarding the need to adhere to the schedule and to adequately staff the project.  See attached August 17, 2012 (Attachment 3), correspondence to BCI further documenting inadequate manpower and staffing levels by BCI at the Project.  BCI's response to that letter is included as Attachment 4.\n\t\t \nThe Project is well behind schedule; BCI is making only slow and minimal progress towards completion and according to the Construction Manager the Project is inadequately staffed by subcontractors and little to no critical path work progress is being made.  Two new stop notices were received by the District last week (see Attachments 5 and 6).\n\t\t \nBrief Contract Analysis\n\t\t \nSection 24.1.1 of the Contract General Conditions provides that the District may terminate the contract and/or terminate the contractor's right to perform the work of the contract for cause based on, among other things, (i) BCI's failure to execute the work with sufficient diligence as will ensure completion within the time specified in the contract, (ii) BCI's failure to complete the work by the scheduled completion date, (iii) BCI's failure to supply enough properly skilled workers or materials to complete the work in the time specified, (iv) BCI's  failure to make prompt payment to subcontractors.\n\t\t \nUpon a determination that any of the grounds for termination exist, the District may serve written notice upon BCI and the Surety of the District's termination of the contract and/or the right to perform the work of the contract.  The notice must contain the reasons for termination.  After service of the notice, BCI shall have three (3) days to cure the violations and to cease the violative conditions.\n\t\t \nUpon termination, the District may immediately serve written notice of tender upon the Surety which will then have the right to take over and perform the project upon notice to the District.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFunding Source:\nMeasure E\n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nTo be determined\n\t \nRecommendation:\nAdministration and Legal Counsel recommend that the Board of Trustees take action based on the above and attached information and that the Board determines on those bases and on such other information as may be presented to the Board that BCI: (1) has failed to execute the Work under the Contract or any separable part thereof with sufficient diligence as would have ensured the Project's completion within the time specified, (2) has failed to complete the Work under the Contract within the time specified; (3) has persistently or repeatedly failed to supply enough properly skilled workers to complete the Work in the time specified; and (4) has failed to make prompt payment to Subcontractors, or for material, or for labor.  Administration further recommends that on the basis of the foregoing the Board delegates to Administration the authority and power to terminate the Contract and/or Contractor's right to perform the Work of the Contract and to serve written notice upon BCI and its Surety of District's termination of the Contract and/or Contractor's right to perform the Work of the Contract in accordance with the terms of the Contract, which notice shall contain the above grounds and such other grounds as Administration may determine after further investigation.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
