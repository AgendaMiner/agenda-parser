I just wanted to email you additional information about the Academy and the NROTC scholarship.\n\t \n\tLast month, I was awarded the 4- Year Navy ROTC scholarship. I may use this scholarship on any of the five universities I've selected (UMich, BU, SDSU, Georgia Tech, and Virginia U) but must train with the military unit on campus. In addition to receiving my B.S. at the end of four years, I will also be commissioned as an officer (Ensign) in the U.S. Navy and will serve for a minimum of 5 years.\n\t \n\tThe academy is a bit different in that gaining an acceptance immediately gives me a full ride scholarship. I was invited for an all-expense paid Candidate Visitation Weekend in July (the actual visit was two weeks ago). On the first night there, I was given a \"Letter of Assurance\" by the Dean. This LOA ensures my acceptance so long as I fulfill the last requirement on the checklist (nomination from the Congressman/Senator). Less than 200 LOAs are given out per year (out of a class of 1200 students) and by receiving one, I am almost guaranteed a nomination. Similar to NROTC, I will also be commissioned as an Ensign and must serve a minimum of 5 years after college. \n\t \n\tThanks for your time!\n\t \n\tBest,\n\tTina Le \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Determine that Design-Build Delivery for the Yerba Buena High School New Student Union and Quad Modernization Project will Reduce Project Costs, Expedite the Project’s Completion, or Provide Features not Achievable through the Design-Bid-Build Process\n\t \nOn February 13, 2014, the Board of Trustees approved the Yerba Buena High School New Student Union and Quad Modernization Project, to be funded by Measure E and Measure I Bond proceeds, and School Facilities funds. On February 14, 2013, the Board considered public works construction project delivery methods available for this project, including design-bid-build, design-build, energy service contracting, and lease lease-back.  \n\t \nFor this project, District staff have examined possible construction delivery methods and have concluded that the use of design-build delivery for the project offers the following potential advantages to the District not available under a traditional design-bid-build delivery method:\n\t \nSimplified contracting and contract administration:  There is one contract with the design-build entity instead of separate contracts with an architect and a contractor.   This reduces administrative burden and associated costs.\nCost containment:  The design-build entity is under a contract to complete the project meeting the District’s stated requirements within the contract price.\nCost savings:  Innovative, cost-effective solutions meeting performance criteria can be achieved by collaboration between the designer and builder, adding construction practicality to design imagination.  The builder is involved in the design process from the beginning and can provide helpful insights on construction materials and methods that can make the design more efficient and less costly to construct, operate and maintain. \nEarly cost definition:  Project costs are determined much sooner than with the traditional design-bid-build process. The design-build method enables the District to determine the cost of the project upon award of the design-build contract instead of after Division of the State Architect approval and construction contract bidding. This early cost knowledge allows the District to make informed decisions on detailed scope in order to ensure equity of outcomes among the school sites.\nReduced number of change orders and disputes:  Because the designer and builder are part of the same design-build entity and the District is not the guarantor of the completeness and accuracy of the work of the architect/engineer, the District may avoid conflicts and disputes and the corresponding costs of those conflicts and disputes that can arise between the architect/engineer and construction contractor.\nGreater risk shifting and more efficient risk allocation:  The vesting of design and construction functions under one entity enables proper allocation of risk under the design-build contract, because the contractor’s involvement in constructability review and existing site condition surveys during preconstruction activities reduces or eliminates the need for redesign during the construction phase. \nReduction in adversarial relationships:  The designer and builder are teamed together, working under a single contract.  This teaming can significantly reduce traditional conflicts and finger pointing between designer and contractor, and eliminate the need for the District to referee disputes.\nTime savings:  The design-build entity is allowed the freedom to explore time-saving construction methods or systems, while meeting the District’s stated criteria.  Early coordination between the designer and builder can help prevent construction delays.   Additionally, by overlapping design and construction to some extent, design-build can deliver the project faster than the design-bid-build approach.  Any and all of these elements can accelerate delivery of the new Student Union and modernized Quad.\nAlternative selection process: Design-build entities may be selected on the basis of factors other than price alone.  Design-build entities can assemble a team of architects, engineers, subcontractors and suppliers with whom they have had previous successful collaborations, and that reflect the goals and needs of the project.  The District can select the winning team based on not only price, but also other factors, including technical expertise, life cycle cost over 15 years or more, skilled labor force availability, safety record, successful previous experience, project-specific plans and schedules, design, and other qualitative elements.\n\t \nEducation Code §17250.20 stipulates that upon making a determination by the governing board that it is in the best interest of the District, the board may enter into a design-build contract for both the design and construction of a school facility if that expenditure exceeds two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) if, after evaluation of the traditional design, bid, and build process of school construction and of the design-build process in a public meeting, the governing board makes written findings that use of the design-build process on the specific project under consideration will accomplish one of the following objectives:  reduce comparable project costs, expedite the project's completion, or provide features not achievable through the traditional design-bid-build method.  The governing board also shall review the guidelines developed pursuant to Education Code §17250.40 (Attachment A) and shall adopt a resolution approving the use of a design-build contract pursuant to this chapter prior to entering into a design-build contract.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees, having reviewed the guidelines developed pursuant to Education Code §17250.40, approve the determination that design-build delivery for the Yerba Buena High School New Student Union and Quad Modernization Project will reduce project costs, expedite the project’s completion, or provide features not achievable through the design-bid-build process.\n",

Since CST can no longer be used as a criterion to reclassify English learners to English proficient students, the California Department of Education directed school districts to select another measure to replace the CST.\n\t \nFor the 2014-15 school year, three of the four reclassification criteria remain unchanged:\nAssessment of English language proficiency, using an objective assessment instrument, including but not limited to, the state test of English language development.\nTeacher evaluation, including but not limited to, a review of the student’s curriculum mastery\nParent opinion and consultation\nThe fourth criterion requires a comparison of student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills in English-language arts. The assessments results must have an empirically established range of performance in basic skills based on the performance of English proficient students of the same age.\n\t \nSchool districts may identify assessments they will use to determine that English learners are meeting academic measures that indicate they are ready to reclassify. These assessment instruments need to measure basic skills for all students and produce results that show whether a student is performing at or close to grade level. Regulations also specify that local reclassification criteria must be reviewed by the school district committee on programs and services for English learners. \n\t \nA District team convened to review English learners’ reclassification data, assessment instruments, and cut scores that can be used as the academic criterion for reclassification. The proposed criterion was reviewed and recommended by the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) at their October 2014 meeting.\n\t \n\t \nRequired Criteria\n(California Education Code Section 313[d])\nDistrict Criteria\n\t\t\t\t\t \nStatus\n1. English Language \n    Proficiency Assessment \n California English Language Development Test (CELDT):  \n Overall proficiency level of 4 or 5, and at least a 3 in each\n skill area.\nUnchanged\n2. Teacher Evaluation \n A grade of C- or better in the core subject areas. \nUnchanged\n3. Parental Opinion and Consultation\n Parental notification through the mail.\nUnchanged\n4.
