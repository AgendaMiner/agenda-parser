The Articles of Incorporation were signed by Superintendent Nunez as the “sole incorporator” of the Foundation.  As a result, the Foundation can now actively solicit funds and donations and Legal Counsel is providing guidance as to the necessary and appropriate disclosures to be made for fundraising purposes.To perfect the formation of the Foundation, Officers and Directors of the Foundation must now be appointed who will then adopt By-Laws (including among other things the size and make-up of the Board of Directors, length of terms, etc.) and nominate and appoint a full Board of Directors to serve on the Foundation board.  To accomplish this, Legal Counsel recommends that an initial Board of Directors of three persons be selected and further recommends that the Governing Board appoint one of its members to sit on the initial board of the Foundation, with the remaining person to be selected by the Superintendent.The initial Board will then meet within the next 10-14 days and hold its first meeting to discuss the adoption of appropriate By-Laws for the organization.  Once the By-Laws are approved, the final application for tax-exempt status can be completed and submitted to the IRS.

Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1998, under Section 131 – Secondary Education, has recommended East Side Union High School District for funding for 2008-2012.  The Perkins Act directs us to: (1) continuously upgrade and improve vocational career-technical education programs, (2) integrate academies with vocational education through a coherent sequence of courses to ensure learning in the core academic and technical subjects, (3) provide students with strong experience and understanding of all aspects of an industry, (4) develop, improve, or expand the use of technology in career technical education, (5) provide professional development to vocational teachers, administrators, and counselors, and (6) develop and implement evaluations of vocational and technical education programs carried out with Perkins funds, including assessment of how the needs of special populations are being met.Accomplishments:Our CTE Advisory Committee has reviewed and recommended the development of integrated career programs in the form of academy and CTE cluster programs, identification and training of teacher teams, and continued to monitor the integration of instruction through incorporation of core subject standards and relevancy activities.  We have also refined our Quality Criteria and Standards for Career-Technical Education programs, established career exploration and assessment activities, developed transition sequences to post secondary study, implemented skill certification programs, and developed a support academy for special education students.Our integrated career paths and academies are aligned with state career incentives.  These include increasing access for special population students, implementing activities to ensure that students are developing employability skills, and increasing work-based learning opportunities for studentsThis Local Plan for 2008 – 2012 replaces the ESUHSD Career and Technical Education Plan.
