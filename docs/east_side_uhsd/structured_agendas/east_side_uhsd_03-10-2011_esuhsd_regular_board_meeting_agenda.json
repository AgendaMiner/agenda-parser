The Board hereby determines to reduce services as specified in the recommendation set forth in the recitals above, no later than the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year.\n\t \nB. The Board hereby determines that, as the result of the above-stated reduction of particular kinds of service (the “Reduction in Force”), it will be necessary to terminate at the end of the 2010-2011 school year the employment of certificated employees of the District in a quantity and kind equal to the FTEs specified in the recommendation set forth in the recitals above.\n\t \nC. In order to implement this Reduction in Force, it may be necessary to apply tie-breaking criteria to distinguish among certificated employees who first rendered paid probationary service to the District on the same date.  Pursuant to Education Code section 44955(b), the Board determines that the order of layoff as between employees who first rendered paid service to the District on the same date shall be established on the basis of the criteria set forth in Exhibit A to this Resolution, which are incorporated as though fully set forth herein.\n\t \nD. The criteria set forth in Exhibit A to this Resolution shall also be used to determine the order of reemployment among those certificated employees who first rendered paid probationary service to the District on the same date.  The Superintendent, or his designee, has the discretion to determine the appropriate weight of such criteria and the order in which such criteria are most relevant to serve the needs of the District and students in each tie-breaking situation.\n\t \nE. The Superintendent is directed to send appropriate notices to all employees affected by the above-described reduction of a particular kind of service in accordance with the provisions of the California Education Code, to take all necessary action to implement this Resolution, and to afford the employees all rights to which they are entitled under the law and applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement(s).    \n\t \n\t \nPASSED AND ADOPTED this 10th day of March, 2011.\n\t \n\t \n                                                            BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE \nEAST SIDE UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\t \n\t \n\t \n                                                            By:                                                                   \n                                                                   Lan Nguyen\n                                                                   President of the Board of Trustees of\n                                                                   The East Side Union High School District\n\t \n\t \n\t \n                                                            By:                                                                   \n                                                                   Van Le\n                                                                   Clerk of the Board of Trustees of\n                                                                   The East Side Union High School District\n\t \n\t \nExhibit A\n\t \nTIEBREAKING CRITERIA PURSUANT TO EDUCATION CODE SECTION 44955(b)\n\t \nEmployees sharing the same first date of paid probationary service to the District shall be awarded tiebreaking points on the following basis:\n\t \nCriterion\nPoints\nPossession of credential(s) authorizing service for the District\n4 for each professional clear credential\n\t\t\t\t\t \n3for each preliminary credential\n\t\t\t\t\t \n2for intern credential\n\t\t\t\t\t \n1 for provisional internship permit or short-term staff permit\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPossession of Cross-Cultural Language and Development certificate or its equivalent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n1\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPossession of Bilingual Cross-Cultural Language\nand Development certificate or its equivalent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n1\n\t \nEmployees with a greater number of points shall be considered more senior than employees with a fewer number of points, for purposes of determining order of layoff and order of reemployment.\n\t \nIf application of the foregoing criteria fails to resolve a tie among two or more employees, among the employees who remain tied the employee with the earliest date of issuance of a preliminary or professional clear credential shall be considered the more senior employee.  As among employees who remain tied who have never obtained a preliminary or professional clear credential, the employee with the earliest date of issuance of an intern credential shall be considered the more senior employee.  As among employees who remain tied who have never obtained an intern, preliminary, or professional clear credential, the employee with the earliest date of issuance of an emergency or pre-intern credential, provisional intern permit or short-term staff permit shall be considered the more senior employee.\n\t \nThe Superintendent is authorized to determine the number of tiebreaking points to be awarded to each employee and to determine the manner in which the tiebreaking criteria shall be applied to each employee.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \nCERTIFICATION\n\t \n\t \n\t \nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA            )\n                                                )\nCOUNTY OF SANTA CLARA      )\n\t \n\t \nI, Van Le, Clerk of the Board of Trustees of the East Side Union High School District, do hereby certify that the foregoing Resolution was duly adopted by the Board of Trustees of the East Side Union High School District at a regular meeting held on the 10th day of March, 2011, and that it was so adopted by the following vote:\n\t \n\t \nAYES:                          \n\t \nNOES:                          \n\t \nABSENT:                      \n\t \nABSTAIN:                                 \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t                                                                                                                                               \n                                                                        Clerk of the Board of Trustees\n",
