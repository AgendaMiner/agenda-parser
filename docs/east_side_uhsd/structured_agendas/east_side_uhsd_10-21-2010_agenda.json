(A list of schools and locations of specialized programs will be presented.)\n\t \nAny service a student receives is detailed on a yearly developed Individual Education Plan (IEP).  Again, the primary focus is educational but may include other services needed to assist the student in a accessing curriculum.  Some examples of additional services are:  speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, individual/group counseling services, 1:1 paraeducator assistance and transportation.  We have four Program Specialists, who attend IEP meetings and determine what additional services are needed to help students be successful.\n\t \nSituations do arise when we are unable to meet a student's educational needs at one of our comprehensive campuses.  At this point, placement must be considered at a Non Public School (NPS) to properly serve the student.  A program specialist, after consulation with the department coordinator, is involved in this meeting and decision making process.  (Here I will have a list of nonpublic schools and approximate yearly cost for the students attending for the 2009-10 school year.)\n\t \nWith the joint collaboration of the Transportation and Special Services Departments, transportaton services have been tremendously improved.  Other challenges facing Special Services include:  Program Improvement (PI) involvement, professional development for all staff at all sites, California State Department compliance issues and the resulting costs associated with these issues.\n\t \nAdditional services provided and overseen by Special Services are:\n\t \nTransitional Services\nWorkAbility 1\nExtended School Year (ESY)\nInitial Evaluations\nStudent Study Teams (SST)\nHome/Hospital Instruction\nSection 504 Plans\n",
