Overfelt, Yerba Buena, and James Lick.  The Santa Clara County has certified that each of the four schools have met the “Sufficiency of Textbooks” requirement.  The certification for the schools that are not visited is done by the principal.  Each principal, from the non-visited schools submit a signed “Certification of Textbook Sufficiency”.  \n\t \n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nSenate Bill 6 (Williams)\nState Instructional Materials Allocation\nDistrict Instructional Materials Budget\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTo be determined\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2012/2013-04 as proposed.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action regarding Balanced-Budget Blueprint\n\t \n\t \nA Balanced-Budget Blueprint for Action\n\t\t \nThe Need for Change\nThe long-term future financial viability of the East Side Union High School District has reached a sense of urgency.  Based on current budget assumptions, it is estimated that beginning in FY 2015-16, the District’s reserves will be mostly depleted and the District will be facing a funding cliff.  This situation is primarily a result of millions in lost revenues from the State and a continuing decline in district enrollment.  Although, the District has taken decisive actions over the past 4 years to address the budget shortfall and has reduced expenditures by over $51 million, it has not been enough.  \n\t \nThe School District is now facing what perhaps may be its biggest challenge and that is “time”.  The District does have a window of opportunity from which to make thoughtful and deliberate decisions, however, that window is narrowing.  The District simply can’t afford to continue operating with a mantra of business as usual because it would require more money than we have, and our current operating structure has already been reduced to alarming levels.  The District needs and requires more options in order to ensure long-term fiscal stability. Through the District’s proposed strategic blueprint, we hope to achieve two simple goals: A continuation of high quality district programs and services for staff and students, and a balanced budget by FY 2015-16. \n\t \nWhy This Time Is So Vital\nEven after making drastic budget cuts over the past 4 years totaling $51 million, the School District still faces a financial shortfall estimated at $23 million over the next three years. The sheer size of this deficit demands dramatic rethinking and a plan of action to ensure the long-term viability of the District.\n\t \nRising operational costs, on-going State funding cuts, and the end of Federal stimulus dollars have highlighted deep structural budget issues that must be addressed urgently and strategically.\n\t \nRecently, the District received a letter from the County in acceptance of the District’s 2012-13 budget, however, the County noted in their letter that they were concerned about the District’s on-going fiscal imbalance and they recommended that the District develop an action plan which would bring the District’s budget into balance by FY 2015-16. \n\t \nWhat Does This Mean for Parents, Students, and Staff?\nThe District wants to ensure that there is a process for engaging our stakeholders in the discussion to ensure that each group’s needs and priorities are clearly understood with regard to budgetary realignment.  The scale and pace of any change can sometimes be overwhelming, but the ultimate goal is to ensure the preservation of high quality district programs and services for all East Side students and staff. In addition, the District would like to ensure that there is minimal impact on all groups and that any actions are made in an equitable, fair, streamlined and open process.  \n\t \nOur Strategy for Transformation\nOur long-term strategy for transformation must begin soon.  The time for change is now. Faced with a continuing financial crisis and no apparent relief in the foreseeable future, the East Side Union High School District must begin the painstaking process of structural budget transformation. The goal is to ensure that the District remains fiscally solvent and is able to develop a soft landing approach with regard to budgetary actions and/or recommendations to bring the budget back into balance by FY 2015-16.  This budgetary transformation is about the long-term preservation of programs and services which impact the students, staff, and the community of East Side Union High School District.  All are vital parts of the public education system in East Side.  Only by addressing the current challenges and opportunities of our current budget situation in a focused and systematic approach will we be able to ensure long-term fiscal stability.  \n\t \nRECOMMENDED ESUHSD BUDGET \nBLUEPRINT FOR ACTION\nCommunicate Strategic Road Map to the Board for proposed Blueprint for addressing the District’s long-term Budget Imbalance;  (September 2012) \nHire a Consultant with the following objectives; (September  2012)\nTo review the budget assumptions and analyze each major revenue and expenditure category for the General Fund and ancillary funds to assess for reasonableness; \nTo provide a comparative analysis of revenues, expenses, fund balance reserves, and staffing as compared to similar size and type school districts; \nTo interview and engage key internal staff and bargaining union members in the process for input in developing a framework for multi-year strategies;  \nTo determine and/or confirm the extent of the structural deficit; 1) Identify the size and scope of the problem; 2) Make revenue and expenditure recommendations for reducing and/or eliminating the structural deficit, and 3) Develop a timeline for actions to occur in order for the District to eliminate the structural deficit and align the budget by fiscal year 2015-16. \nConsultant presents the recommendations to the Board for review; (December 2012) \nDistrict will solicit input on the plan from all internal and external stakeholders including parents, students, community partners, district staff, and other stakeholders to help inform about the plan recommendations; (January – February 2013) \nReview stakeholder feedback and recommend actions for the Boards consideration: (February  –  May 2013) \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended ESUHSD Balanced-Budget Blueprint for Action.\n",

These will replace all existing teacher workstations, whether laptop or desktop. The intent is to provide all teachers and administrators with a standard model workstation capable of running all district-approved applications. The primary imperative of the district-wide teacher laptop upgrade is to allow teachers, students, and parents to work together in a mutually supportive network that helps enhance student performance. \n                                               \nThe funding is available via the District’s Measure E Bond to support this project.  The Measure E Information Technology Budget has set aside qualifying accounts for “Classroom Learning Tools” and “Upgrade District-wide Network System\". \n\t \nThe hard cost for this project is estimated to be $1.4 million, with an additional $200 thousand set aside for soft cost, taxes, and contingency.  A budget of $1.6 million is therefore recommended. \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the installation of 1,250 district-standard teacher laptop workstations. \n",
