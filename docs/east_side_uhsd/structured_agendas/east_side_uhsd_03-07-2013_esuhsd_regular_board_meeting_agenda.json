The remediation work needs to proceed immediately as the longer the soot and debris remains in place the more difficult the odor removal process can be and the smoke and soot will have a corrosive effect on the facility and its contents.  Moreover, an architectural firm, with structural, mechanical, electrical and hazardous materials sub-consultants, will need to assess the extent of the damage, develop repair plans, seek approval from the Division of the State Architect; then a construction contract will need to be awarded to implement the repairs.  The entire process is anticipated to take several months to execute, provided the normal time frames and processes related to procurement of the professional and construction services is bypassed.  The Emergency Resolution Declaring an Emergency enables the District to forgo the normal time frame and processes related to the work and to engage a contractor(s) for the repair and remediation work without advertising for or inviting bids.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nFINANCIAL IMPACT:\nUnknown at this time\n\t\t\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nProperty/Liability\n\t\t\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution 2012/2013-22 declaring an emergency pursuant to Public Contract Code section 1104 and 20113 and authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into contracts for the repair and remediation of the fire damage at B Villa at Independence High School.\n\t \n",
