Brief Introduction and Summary of Recommendation\nOn June 7, 2012, the East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) approved the renewal petition for the San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School (SJCCCS), for the required five-year term, pursuant to Education Code § 47607 (a) (1). The term of the charter began on July 1, 2012, and will end on June 30, 2017.  \n\t\t \nThe SJCCCS provides its target population of “low income, high-risk” students, ages 17½ and older (\"no age limit for registry\"), an educational program for the completion of the high school diploma requirements and job skills training, including work experience. The SJCCCS operates at two San Jose locations, the Berger Street campus and the Senter Road campus. Based on the recently submitted P1 Attendance Report which averages the attendance over a four-month period (August 18th – December 5th), SJCCCS has an enrollment of approximately 372 students.\n\t\t \nThe East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) received an application for participation in the Alternative Schools Accountability Model (ASAM) from the SJCCCS on January 12, 2015. The ASAM, approved under the California Public Schools Accountability Act, establishes the California Department of Education as the responsible entity for developing systems of accountability to which all schools shall be held. More specifically, Education Code § 52052 (h) required:\n\t\t \nThe Superintendent, with the approval of the State Board of Education, shall develop an alternative accountability system for schools under the jurisdiction of the county board of education or a county superintendent of schools, community day schools, . . . and alternative schools serving high-risk pupils, including continuation high schools and opportunity schools.\n\t\t \nII. San Jose Conservation Corps’ ASAM Participation\nThe SJCCCS’s rationale for pursuing ASAM participation is to allow the school to gain a more accurate measure of its progress in educating low-income, high-risk students. Measures used by regular schools do not adequately assess SJCCCS’s student and school performance. SJCCCS administrators feel that the ASAM will provide a set of metrics, from which data can be generated to more accurately measure the good work the school is doing in its educational programs designed to create the successful completion of high school for its high-risk students.\n  \nASAM schools receive an API score; however, they are not “included in the API rankings”.  Furthermore, these schools, “held accountable under the Academic Performance Index (API)” do “receive growth targets as all other schools” and must also meet the Federal Adequate Yearly progress (AYP) consistent with “all other schools”.\n\t\t \nIII. District Administration's Recommendation for San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School\nThe State Board of Education requires that charter schools desiring participation in ASAM receive approval from the “local district governing board”. The San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School Board approved the ASAM application on January 8, 2015 (Attachment A).\n\t\t \nThe District Administration requests that the Board approve the Alternative Schools Accountability Model Application for the San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School\n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School's Alternative Schools Accountability Model (ASAM) Application.\n\t \n",
