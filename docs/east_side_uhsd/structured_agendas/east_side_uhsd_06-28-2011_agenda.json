With assistance from committee members, information was shared and stakeholders had opportunities to comment on suggested plans.  Andrew Hill held town hall meetings with staff and parents to gather input, and Independence shared their progress with staff at meetings and parents during School Site Council meetings.\nChoose one of the four following options as their restructuring/alternative governance structure.\n               a.  Close the school and reopen it as a charter school.\n               b.  Replace all or most of the school staff (which may include the principal) who are\n                    relevant to the failure to make AYP.\n               c.  Enter into a contract with an entity, such as a private management company with\n                    a demonstrated record of effectiveness, to operate the public school.\n               d.  Implement any other major restructuring of the school's governance arrangement\n                    that makes fundamental reforms and leads to improved student achievement.\n\t\t \n          After completing the CDE recommended protocol, Andrew Hill and Independence selected \n          D, that is, to implement an alternative governance structure.\n\t\t \n          Andrew Hill High School plan for alternative governance structure - The main focus areas   \n          of alternative governance structure are as follows:\n  \n                 *  Smaller Learning Communities\n                 *  Whole school participation by department of Professional Development focusing\n                     on engaging students\n                 *  Assessing student learning\n                 *  Extending learning to close the achievement gap\n\t\t \n\t\t \n           Independence High School plan for alternative governance structure - The three main\n           focus areas of their alternative governance structure are as follows:\n\t\t \n                 *  Develop and align instruction with content standards with focus on English language\n                     learners and special education.\n                 *  Implement common assessments and ongoing collaboration to inform staff about the\n                     effectiveness of instruction.\n                 *  Implement an intervention plan for students with multiple \"F\" grades.\n          \n      4. Ensure that the school’s Single Plan for Student Achievement reflects the alternative\n          governance structure chosen above.\n\t\t   \n          The alternative governance structure is represented in both Andrew Hill's Single Plan for\n          Student Achievement and Independence's Single Plan for Student Achievement.\n\t\t \n          The DSLT will continue to meet on a regular basis at both high schools to look at student \n          achievement data and monitor the alternative governance plan.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Governance Structures at Andrew Hill and Independence High Schools.\n",

This Collaborative is a national project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the goal of easing tension between districts and their charter schools and changing the often antagonistic relationships into collaborative ones. The Gates Foundation has funded many such compacts in major cities across the country. Each District who applies for the Gates Foundation Grant is eligible to receive $100,000 to get the compact off the ground and successful districts will then be eligible to apply for a larger grant which will fund in the million dollar range.\n\t \nSan Jose is unique from other districts across the nation that have signed successful charter compacts in that there are many districts operating within the city rather than just one district, and those districts have unique charter schools and also share charter schools with other districts and the Santa Clara County Office of Education making the interrelationships among us complicated. It is the intent of the compacts signed by the districts, charter schools, and County Office to have some common elements that align and match creating continuity among schools.\n\t \nDan Moser, Frank Biehl, Lan Nguyen, and Marisa Hanson participated in the opening discussions at the County Office and determined that it was a worthwhile project. Since then the team that composed the draft compact is, Kirsten King, Vito Chiala, Teresa Marquez, Grettel Castro-Stanley, and representatives from Latino College Prep, KIPP, Escuela Popular, and Summit Public Schools. San Jose Conservation Corp was invited to participate but has not joined the effort. \n \nThe target areas of the East Side compact are aligned with the Gates Foundation Focus areas and are:\n\t \n\t      *  Replicate high performing schools & closing low performing school - East Side will use an \n         alternative by:\n            - Creating a common metric and definition for a standard performance level for schools\n            - Developing a common monitoring protocol\n\t \n    *  Data transparency & sharing\n\t               - Demographics, performance, enrollment\n\t \n    *  Resource sharing\n            - Facilities, bonds & parcel tax, special education, economies of scales, and students\n\t \n    *  Sharing/replicating best practices\n            - Professional Development\n\t \nThe draft compact is included as a separate document and contains specific items described in greater detail.\n\t \nThe final compacts must be sent to the Gates Foundation by the end of August and are due to the Santa Clara County Office of Education by August 24th. Because of the tight timeline and no scheduled board meetings until August 30th, we are asking the board to submit any feedback on the compact to Dan Moser as soon as possible and that the Board authorize Dan Moser as Superintendent to approve the compact, in final form, on behalf of the Board.\n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nN/A\n\t \nFunding Source:\nN/A\n\t \nRecommendation: \nIt is recommended that the Board authorize East Side administration to continue working on the compact with East Side authorized charter schools and to authorize Dan Moser as Superintendent to approve the compact, in final form, on behalf of the board.\n",

At that time Administration told the Board that the final reconciliation of the PCO’s (Potential Change Orders) for the entire project would be brought back to the Board at a later date. Now that the Santa Teresa High School Title IX Modernization project is complete, Administration is providing the Board with the following reconciliation of the construction project purchase order #101424 with John Plane Construction.  Change Order #2 decreases the actual purchase order by $31,637.62 which means the final total amount went over the base bid amount by 14%.\n\t \nChange Order #2 is being submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval so that the purchase order can be decreased and all outstanding invoices can be paid accordingly.
