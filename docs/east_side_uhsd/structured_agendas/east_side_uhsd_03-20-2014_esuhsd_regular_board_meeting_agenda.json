The school district shall make reasonable efforts to provide the charter school with facilities near to where the charter school wishes to locate, and shall not move the charter school unnecessarily.”  \n\t\t\t\t\t \nThe term “operating” is defined in section 47614(b)(5), which provides:\n“The term ‘operating,’ as used in this section, shall mean either currently providing public education to in-district students, or having identified at least 80 in-district students who are meaningfully interested in enrolling in the charter school for the following year.”\n\t\t\t\t\t \nSection 11969.2 of the Regulations defines “in-district students” as used in Education Code section 47614(b), in pertinent part, as a student who is entitled to attend the schools of the District “and could attend a school district-operated school.”\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIn support of its facilities request, LVLA submitted copies of twenty-seven (27) Intent to Enroll (“ITE”) forms for the 2014-2015 school year with the names of 32 separate identifiable potential students for its school.  However, thirteen (13) of the students identified in the ITE forms specify grade levels in 2014-2015 not served by the District and therefore do not qualify as “in-district” students within the meaning of Section 47614 or Regulation 11969.2.  In addition, one of the ITE forms was not signed by a parent.  On that basis, LVLA failed to meet the threshold of 80 in-district students pursuant to Education Code section 47614.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nFunding Source:\nNot applicable.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot applicable.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nRecommendation: \nIt is recommended for the reasons stated above, that the Board of Trustees authorize Administration to approve the denial of Proposition 39 Facilities requested by Luis Valdez Leadership Academy Charter School.\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n",

The primary purpose of CEQA is to inform decision makers of the environmental consequences of their actions through the completion of an initial study and environmental evaluation of potential impacts, and to identify any mitigation measures that will be employed.\n\t \nAn Initial Study was prepared for the Silver Creek Stadium Lighting Project, in conformance with the requirements of CEQA. On the basis of the Initial Study, the District has determined that the proposed project will not result in a significant effect on the environment because the mitigation and avoidance measures described in the Initial Study are included in the project. The Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND - Attachment A) and Mitigation Monitoring or Reporting Program (MMRP - Attachment B) describes the mitigation and avoidance measures.\n\t \nUpon review of the MND and MMRP, the Board resolves to adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration, stating that the environmental effects from the proposed project will not result in a significant effect on the environment.  \n\t \nFiscal Impact:                                                                                                   \nNot Applicable\n\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2013/14-21 – Resolution to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Stadium Lighting Project at Silver Creek High School in Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act.\n",

That plan included over $9 million of mechanical and electrical equipment repairs and/or replacements at all District sites. The California Clean Energy Jobs Act was created with the approval of Proposition 39 in the November 2012 statewide general election. Proposition 39 allocates projected revenue to the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund for five fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 2013/14.  Under the initiative, roughly $550 million is annually available to be appropriated by the Legislature for eligible projects to improve energy efficiency and expand clean energy generation; roughly $5 million has been allocated to the District and another $1.5 million to charter schools housed in District facilities.  Some aging and/or failing mechanical and electrical system and controls components are not covered by the Measure G site improvement/deferred maintenance plan, and may not be eligible for Proposition 39 funding; those repairs could be covered using deferred maintenance funds. The Districtwide Energy Efficiency Project is funded by these combined funding sources.  \n\t \nGovernment Code Section 4217.10 – 4217.18 authorizes public agencies to enter into agreements with qualified energy services contract providers. However, before awarding an energy services contract, the Governing Board must first determine and find in a public hearing, that the net benefits of the energy conservation measures to be provided through the contract are greater than the expense of the contracted improvements. The authorizing Government Code section does not mandate a formal selection process; however, Administration deemed it prudent to solicit Statements of Qualifications (SOQ) from interested firms, to ensure transparency and allow the District to enter into a contract with a provider who offers the best value. On January 10, 2014, the District solicited Statements of Qualifications from highly qualified and experienced firms to design and construct cost effective energy performance improvements at District sites, including management of the associated Proposition 39 grant application process and compliance with all verification, benchmarking, reporting and other requirements defined by the California Energy Commission. The firms were required to meet these minimum requirements:\nAccredited by the National Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO)\nIncluded on the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Qualified List of Energy Service Companies\nSuccessfully implemented at least five (5) energy performance contracts for the K-12 public sector of at least $5 million each in California in the last five (5) years\nCalifornia B contractor license\nMinimum of $15 million in bonding capacity for a single project\nThe solicitation delineated weighted selection criteria by which the firms would be evaluated. Three proposals were received on February 6, 2014. The qualifications of the three respondents were evaluated and scored. The final scores evidenced the quality and capacity of each of the respondents to bring value to the project:\n\t \n\t \nEvaluation Criteria\nJohnson Controls\nChevron Energy Solutions\nClimatec\nMaximum Points\nBackground\n20\n20\n18\n20\nProject Team & Management Structure\n25\n25\n20\n25\nProject History & References\n18\n20\n18\n20\nProject Approach\n25\n22\n20\n25\nAdditional Benefits & Added Value\n35\n35\n32\n35\nSavings\n35\n35\n35\n35\nContract Form and Fee Proposal\n25\n35\n30\n35\nComprehensiveness of Response\n5\n5\n5\n5\nTotal Score\n188\n197\n178\n200\nTotal Score Percentage\n94%\n99%\n89%\n100%\n\t \nAdministration at this time requests approval of a Program Development Agreement pursuant to which chevron Energy Solutions will define the scope recommended of energy improvements and costs and net savings to the District from such work.\n\t \nChevron Energy Solutions was found to offer the best overall value to the District in nearly every category, including proposed fees. Chevron Energy Solutions has enjoyed a very successful relationship with East Side on the solar photovoltaic, interior lighting and pool pump installations that have exceeded energy savings expectations. Chevron has successful experience working with local labor to better the community and under the requirements of the District’s Project Labor Agreement. Along with the facility improvements and energy conservation measures that will provide healthier learning environments and reduce energy and operational expenses, it is anticipated that 30 jobs will be created over the course of five years.  \n\t \nThe California Conservation Corps (CCC) receives an allocation from the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund to perform energy surveys and other energy conservation-related activities for public schools. The CCC will conduct energy surveys to assess building conditions, identify energy efficiency opportunities, and establish baseline use at no cost to the District. The District applied for and was approved to receive these services.  Chevron Energy Services will work with CCC to coordinate this work, receive and utilize their survey results – providing the young adults and veterans that the CCC program serves with valuable work experience and training in the energy field.  \n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot to exceed $17.5 million\n\t \nFunding Source:\nMeasure G \nProposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Act funds\nDeferred Maintenance funds\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the Associate Superintendent of Business Services to execute a Program Development Agreement with Chevron Energy Solutions Company to determine the specific energy conservation measures that will be used to support a proposed Energy Services Contract. Once it is determined through that process that the cost of the Energy Services Contract will be outweighed by the net savings provided through the improvements and energy conservation measures, those results and findings will be presented to the Board in accordance with the Government Code for the authorization to enter into and Energy Services Contract with Chevron Energy Solutions.\n",

That plan included swimming pool upgrades at eight (8) sites: Independence, Yerba Buena, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant and W.C. Overfelt High Schools, budgeted at $5.23 million. The intent of the project was to perform basic repairs as delineated in the 2004 Facilities Master Plan. \n\t \nOn May 10, 2012, the Board of Trustees awarded the design professional services contract for the Swimming Pool Modernizations project to Arch Pac Aquatics (Item 16.05). Arch Pac Aquatics developed drawings and specifications approved by the Division of the State Architect (DSA) for modernization of the pools at Independence High School.  The swimming pools at Independence High School were modernized as a stand-alone project, which was completed in July 2013.\n\t \nThe Board of Trustees, pursuant to Education Code §17250.20, adopted Resolution #2012/2013-26 on March 21, 2013, to approve use of the design-build delivery method for the Swimming Pool Modernizations project affecting the remaining seven (7) school sites (Item 15.03).\n\t \nDesign-Build Entity (DBE) Selection Criteria\nThe Request for Proposal (RFP) specified that the following criteria were to be considered in selecting the DBE whose proposal demonstrated the “best value” to the District, as defined in Education Code §17250.15. The “best value” basis of evaluation allows the District to select a DBE based on more than price alone, one of the advantages of design-build in comparison to traditional delivery methods. The first five (5) criteria are required by Education Code §17250.25, the Code section under which this design-build project is to be awarded. The additional criteria, which are critical to the success of the project, were added at the District’s discretion.\n    \n   \n1.\nPrice\n20 points\n2.\nTechnical Expertise\n8 points\n3.\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years\n8 points\n4.\nSkilled Labor Force Availability\n8 points\n5.\nAcceptable Safety Record\n8 points\n6.\nSchedule\n20 points\n7.\nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation\n9 points\n8.\nProject Management Plan\n10 points\n9.\nProgram Requirements\n9 points\n                                                 TOTAL (Maximum)\n100 points\n\t \n\t \nDistrict Review Panel\nRecognizing the importance of early input by site staff and end users, a District review panel was established to assist in the DBE selection process. This review panel consisted of the Subject Area Coordinator for Health and Physical Education, a delegate from each of the 7 pool sites, swimming pool and boiler maintenance technicians, Capital Purchasing and Facilities staff, and the Blach Construction management team. \n\t \nProposal Scoring\nThe District received proposals from two DBEs. Based on the proposal evaluation criteria described above, the final score for each DBE is as follows:\n\t \nEvaluation Criteria\nGonsalves & Stronck Construction\nStrawn Construction\nMaximum Possible\nPrice\n8\n6\n20\nTechnical Expertise\n8\n6\n8\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years\n8\n7\n8\nSkilled Labor Force Availability\n8\n7\n8\nAcceptable Safety Record\n8\n7\n8\nSchedule\n19\n17\n20\nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design-Innovation\n8\n6\n9\nProject Management Plan\n9\n7\n10\nProgram Requirements\n9\n8\n9\nTotal\n85\n71\n100\n\t \nThe review panel unanimously agreed that Gonsalves & Stronck Construction Company, Inc. (G&S) provided a proposal that offers the best value to the District. The panel also concluded that additional investigation with G&S of pool design configurations is warranted. By awarding a programming and schematic design contract to G&S, they will meet with school site and district staff to further refine their proposed designs and associated pricing. This activity will transpire in late March and April, allowing District administration to carry forth to the Board in May a recommendation of contract amendment to finalize design and proceed with construction.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot to Exceed $276,564                                                                             \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure G\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve award of the programming and schematic design scope of a design-build contract for the Swimming Pool Modernizations Project to Gonsalves & Stronck Construction Company, Inc., in an amount not to exceed $276,564.\n",

The RFQ was advertised in local publications on December 26, 2013 and again on January 2, 2014, supplemented by staff’s outreach efforts to over forty (40) architectural firms whose portfolio of work includes similar projects. \n\t \nNineteen (19) Statements of Qualification (SOQ) were received on January 24, 2014. The SOQs were reviewed and scored by the Capital Purchasing Department using the weighted criteria delineated in the RFQ. SOQs were also reviewed by Facilities Planning staff who concurred with the assigned scores.  \n\t \nBased on this evaluation, Administration is recommending that the following firms be added to the existing pool of firms who are qualified to provide architectural services:  \nANLA Associates, Inc.\nArtik Art & Architecture\nATI Architects & Engineers\nCarducci & Associates, Inc.\nDeems Lewis McKinley Architecture\nDougherty + Dougherty Architects, LLP\nGates + Associates\nGould Evans, Inc.\nHamilton + Aitken Architects\nHibser Yamauchi Architects\nK2A Architecture + Interiors\nLCA Architects\nLPA, Inc.\nMcKim Design Group\nMVE Institutional, Inc.\nQuattrocchi Kwok Architects\ntBP/Architecture, Inc.\nVallier Design Associates, Inc.\nVaughn Williams Architecture + Planning\n\t \nThe firms who were deemed qualified to provide architectural services in June 2008 will remain in the qualified pool.  Capital Purchasing staff confirmed that their licenses are in good standing:\nAedis Architects\nIBI Group (formerly BFGC)\nCody Anderson Wasney\nFacilities Management, Planning & Operations\nHMC Architects\nNTD Architects\nPerkins & Will\nSpencer Associates\nSugimura Finney Architects\nVerde Design\nWLC Architects\n\t \nIt is in the District’s best interest to allow interested architectural firms to join the pool over time, and to actively expand the pool to also include firms who provide design services in engineering disciplines (structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, etc.), as well as other types of professional service providers whose services are critical to a successful construction program (e.g., commissioning).  Administration will bring forth to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis (as needed) recommendations to add qualified professional service providers to the pool.\n\t \n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the addition of the listed nineteen (19) firms to the pool of firms qualified to provide architectural services.\n",
