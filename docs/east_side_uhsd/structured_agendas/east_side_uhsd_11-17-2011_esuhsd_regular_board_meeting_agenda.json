Based on a  favorable life insurance  environment, the district requested that Gallagher Benefit Services market the district to other carriers. The market was very competitive and the district received 12 life insurance quotes.  A review of the quotes and resulting negotiations determined that Unum Insurance was the most favorable for the district. Unum insurance plan increases each employee and Board Members life insurance coverage from $25,000 to $40,000.  In addition, Unum has offered to replace the district’s current employee assistance program (EAP) through Ceridian with their own EAP program which is also with Ceridian at no costs to the district. The benefit coverage remains unchanged and employees will not experience any difference in the plans.  Since Unum Insurance is including the EAP in their life program, the change from Standard Insurance to Unum Insurance will result in a net savings to the district of $62,648 annually and a higher benefit level for each employee.  \n\t\t\t \nIn addition to the district’s basic life insurance coverage, each employee and Board Member will have the option to purchase optional voluntary life coverage for themselves, their spouse and children. The coverage is very inexpensive and provides a guaranteed issuance of $200,000 for the employee, $50,000 for a spouse, and $10,000 per child with no questions asked.   The voluntary life program is portable and employees would have an opportunity to retain the coverage for themselves and their family should they leave the district’s employment.   \n\t\t\t \nThe plan changes would take effect on January 1, 2012 for the district coverage.  The voluntary life program will be marketed for a March 1, 2012 implementation and would be contingent upon at least 15% of the districts employees signing up\nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$62,648.00 (Annual Savings)\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nNot Applicable\n\t \n",

Falk Construction, Inc. \nRe: Violation of Public Contract Code Sections 4104 and 4106 and Possible Imposition \nof Remedies as Allowed by Law\n\t \n\t \nThe Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act (Public Contract Code Sections 4100 et seq.) requires that a prime contractor on a public works project shall, for each subcontract in excess of ½ of 1% of the prime contractor’s total bid, list in his or her bid each such subcontractor and the portion of the work to be subcontracted to the subcontractor. The Act further provides that if a prime contractor violates the Act, the public agency may cancel the contract or impose a penalty of up to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the subcontracted work at issue.\n\t \nOn June 28, 2011, the Board approved the award of the contract for the Yerba Buena High School Title IX Interior Modernization Project to D.L. Falk Construction, Inc. (“DLF”) in the total amount of $3,509,000.  As required by law, DLF submitted to the District a Designated Subcontractors List specifying each subcontractor on the project and the portion of the work to be performed by the subcontractor.  DLF’s Subcontractor List did not designate any subcontractor for rough framing.\n\t \nPursuant to Public Contract Code section 4106, if a prime contractor fails to specify a subcontractor for any portion of work to be performed under the contract which work is in excess of one-half of 1 percent of the prime contractor's total bid, the prime contractor agrees that he or she is fully qualified to perform that portion himself or herself, and that the prime contractor (here, DLF) shall perform that portion himself or herself.  If, after the award of contract, the prime contractor subcontracts any such portion of the work, the prime contractor shall be subject to the penalties named in Sections 4110 and 4111 (grounds for discipline before the State Contractor’s License Board).\n\t \nEarlier this month the District received information indicating the presence of subcontractors at the Yerba Buena job site not included on DLF’s Subcontractors List and performing work (rough carpentry work) that had not been indicated on the Subcontractor’s List to be performed by any subcontractor.  By letter dated November 4, 2009, the District (by and through FMPO, the District’s construction manager for the project) notified D.L. Falk and requested that DLF provide clarification and information as to the use of undesignated subcontractors at the project site.  A response was received from DLF on November 7, 2011.  (Copies of the letters are attached.)\n\t \nThe District has now received a copy of the subcontract between DLF and subcontractor Argo Construction, Inc. in the amount of $115,000 for “rough carpentry” on the YBHS project.  Argo Construction was not designated by DLF on the Subcontractors List, nor was any subcontractor designated by DLF on the Subcontractor’s List for rough carpentry.  The contract amount ($115,000.00) exceeds the threshold of one-half of one percent for requiring District approval.\n\t \nPublic Contract Code section 4110 provides:\n\t \n“A prime contractor violating any of the provisions of this chapter violates his or her contract and the awarding authority may exercise the option, in its own discretion, of (1) canceling his or her contract or (2) assessing the prime contractor a penalty in an amount of not more than 10 percent of the amount of the subcontract involved, and this penalty shall be deposited in the fund out of which the prime contract is awarded. In any proceedings under this section the prime contractor shall be entitled to a public hearing and to five days' notice of the time and place thereof.”\n\t \nAll of the above provisions of the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act are incorporated into and made a part of the contract between the District and DLF for the YBHS project.\n\t \nThe information received to date raises a serious issue of whether DLF has violated the Subletting and Subcontracting Fair Practices Act provisions noted above.  If so, then the District would be authorized to impose the penalties specified under Public Contract Code section 4110.\n\t \nBased on the information available to date, Administration recommends that the Board authorize and direct Administration to proceed with an public administrative hearing under Public Contract Code section 4110, that the Board appoint Associate Superintendent Marcus Battle or his designee to serve as the hearing officer for the matter, that Mr. Battle hold the hearing and provide D.L. Falk Construction, Inc. notice of the hearing as required by law, that Mr. Battle, after hearing the evidence, render a decision including but not limited to what remedies under Public Contract Code section 4110 may be appropriate, and that the decision be presented to the Board for approval and adoption at the next Regular Board Meeting.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot Yet Applicable\n\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution #2011/2012-15: (i) authorizing and directing Administration to proceed with an public administrative hearing under Public Contract Code section 4110, (ii) appointing Associate Superintendent Marcus Battle or his designee to serve as the hearing officer for the matter, (iii) directing Mr. Battle to hold the hearing and provide D.L.

According to the district’s auditor, Vavrinek, Trine, and Day, the resolution should have been presented and approved at the time in which BP3105 was adopted, however, this did not occur.\n\t\t\t \nThe District is recommending a change in the adopted reserve for economic uncertainties because the district now believes that maintaining a minimum reserve of 3% is not prudent in the current fiscal environment.  As a testament of this fact, please read the following excerpt from School Services of California:\n\t\t\t \nDuring times like these, as budgets are being cut and local agencies are required to do more with less, the question always comes up about reserves—is this the time to spend them or bolster them? Adequate reserves, and the cash component of reserves, are key to fiscal stability. What follows are our thoughts about adequate reserves for school districts, in good times and bad.\n\t\t\t \nWhat are Reserves For?\nReserves are a safety net that allow a district to meet its obligations, and are especially important in an environment of uncontrollable cost increases, volatile revenue sources, and other surprises that can and do happen. A district typically has some control over costs, but very little control over revenues, especially as the state tightens its belt and reduces the resources going to local districts. Reserves allow a district to have cash on hand to meet its obligations even when hit with unexpected financial turbulence.\n\t\t\t \nRemember that most financial problems are really multiyear problems and not one time. Reserves are one-time funds—once used, they are not replaced except by purposeful action of the district. Therefore, reserves can be used to carry a district through a year of financial problems until the district can make enough cuts in its budget to address the ongoing financial issues. It would take a significant amount of reserves to solve an ongoing budget problem, even temporarily, if no other actions are taken to right-size the budget.\n\t\t\t \nDistricts that do not have adequate reserves to begin with are the first ones that get into financial trouble when the state cuts funding—and, unfortunately, there is a long history reflecting many periods of flat state funding and/or cuts to school districts.\n\t\t\t \nHow Much in Reserves is Really Needed?\nThe Standards and Criteria has established a minimum reserve for Economic Uncertainties of 3% for most districts in the state depending on size. Smaller districts are required to have more than 3%, while larger districts in some instances are required to have less. That 3% is the minimum prudent level of reserves—with emphasis on the word \"minimum.\" This means that districts that have additional risk factors need to have higher reserves. Here are some examples of possible risk factors:\nDeclining enrollment\nDelays in cash receipts (for example, apportionment deferrals)\nOther restricted district funds that may require unrestricted general fund contributions\nUnstable labor relations\nDependence on property taxes (\"basic aid\" districts)\nDebt service risks\nRelatively small district size\nHistory of deficit spending and/or projected future deficit spending\nReliance on one-time revenue sources\nExposure to significant one-time expenditures (such as inadequate resources for a facilities project or a large uninsured claim against the district)\n\t\t\t \nIf any one or more of the above risk factors exist in your district, it would be prudent to set aside additional reserves beyond the state required minimum. Keep in mind that a 3% reserve covers only about seven or eight days of payroll for a district. Many districts have in place a Board policy that requires a higher reserve level—8%, 10%, or more. It would be a good idea to include some language in the policy that addresses how and when the reserves will be replenished, if there is an unforeseen situation that takes it below the Board-established minimum.\n\t\t\t \nFor the 2009-10 fiscal year, the latest year for which there is state-certified data, unrestricted general fund balances as a percentage to the total general fund budget were:\nUnified School Districts—10.40%\nElementary School Districts—16.83%\nHigh School Districts—15.22%\n\t\t\t \nWhen balances from Fund 17 Special Reserve are added to the above expenditures, the percentages are:\nUnified School Districts—11.28%\nElementary School Districts—19.05%\nHigh School Districts—17.98%\n\t\t\t \nConclusion\nIn setting a reserve level, the goal is to have the resources necessary to meet both planned and unplanned financial challenges, while spending as much of the current year's resources as possible on the current year's programs and students. This is a balancing act that will be unique to each district as it examines the risk factors that apply in order to determine how much is needed in reserves.\n\t\t\t \nOne final thought: it would seem illogical that, during this time of state funding cuts, a district's reserves are found to be higher this year than before. However, it makes sense when you consider the one—time infusion of federal funds, the cuts in expenditures that have been made, and the actions taken to conserve cash when the state is holding onto your cash longer. Districts with higher reserves right now should not apologize for it—rather, you should give yourself a pat on the back if this is the case in your district. It means that your district has been strategic and prudent in managing its fiscal affairs during this very difficult time and is well prepared to handle the bumps in the road still to come.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the amendment and adoption to Board Policy 3105 Fund Balance (GASB 54). \n\t \n",

The District’s Bond Advisors recently informed the Board that there may be limitations on future bond sales. As a result, the Board directed staff to prepare a plan that would account for a reduction in gross Measure E proceeds, while accounting for the District’s equity allocation goals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nIn February 2009, the Board of Trustees approved a $349 million Equity-Allocation plan for the District’s 11 campuses. The Board concurrently authorized 31 Phase I projects, valued at $130 million, and enabled acquisition of the Calero High School site for $20 million. The allocations for Mt. Pleasant and Calero High Schools have since been augmented with Board approval, bringing the total budget for Phase I projects to $161 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nThe February 2009 Board action further defined two additional tiers of projects: those that were “on-deck” for implementation (Phase II) and those that would be implemented subject to availability of funds after completion of Phases I & II. The Board has subsequently authorized proceeding with Phase II projects, valued at $86 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nTo date, the District has secured approximately $174.5 million for its Measure E capital construction program. With this funding, the District can expect the following:\nCompletion of Phase I projects, \nAcquisition of the Calero High School site, \n50% completion of the Measure E Information Technology program\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nAssuming current plans remain unaltered, at the conclusion of Phase II there would be significant equity distribution gaps. Given limitations on available funding going forward, the District should consider two alternative scenarios through which Equity Allocation goals can be maximized: 1) moving forward with a limited Phase III in the amount of $13 million, focused on closing equity distribution gaps or 2) redressing equity distribution by realigning project budgets in Phase II (and Phase I to a limited extent). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nA plan that includes Phase III (Alternative A) will require approval of bond sales totaling $110 million (including a Capitol Appreciation Bond in the amount of $20 million). A plan based on a realigned Phase II (Alternative B) will require $90 million in bond sales (and will not require a Capitol Appreciation Bond). In either scenario, the District’s goal is to achieve equity distribution of Measure E funding at 80% or higher for all 11 campuses.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$264.5 Million \n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure E\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees: 1) Adopt Measure E Bond Program Implementation Plan Alternative B (without $20M CAB) and 2) Authorize staff to proceed with realignment of Measure E Bond projects, adjusting project budgets to maximize equity distribution based on total available funds.\n\t \n",

At its meeting of September 15, 2011, East Side’s Board of Trustees approved a “Deferred Maintenance” initiative to be funded from remaining Measure G proceeds, as follows:\n166 individual projects, \non 13 sites, and\nwith an estimated combined cost of $27.9 million\nConsistent with the mandate of the Measure G program, these projects are focused on improving safety & security and reducing operating costs through repairing & equipping aging sites and facilities. This investment is essential for addressing critical needs and ensuring the long term value of the District’s physical assets. After this Deferred Maintenance initiative, approximately $12 million will remain unencumbered in Measure G.\n\t\t\t \nUpon further consideration, the same objectives may be served and the value of the Deferred Maintenance initiative will be enhanced by combining it with site improvements that include field upgrades, capital equipment replacement for food services district-wide, and updating of civil infrastructure surveys for all sites.
