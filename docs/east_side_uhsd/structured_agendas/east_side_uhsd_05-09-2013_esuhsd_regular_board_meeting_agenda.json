The award is named for Glenn W. Hoffmann, who served as the Superintendent of Santa Clara County schools from 1967 to 1984.\nA committee of school administrators and board members scored entries from several Santa Clara County school programs. This year, awards were given to the top five programs, which received the highest scores out of 17 total entries.\nThe demands of our changing economy and the need to foster a more educated workforce inspired the creation of an innovative partnership between the Franklin-McKinley School District, the East Side Union High School District, and Evergreen Valley College. Our three communities will increase the number of first generation college graduates, equipping them with the education and experience they need to succeed in life and family-supporting careers. With the support and involvement of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the College Connection Academy welcomed its first 7th grade class in 2008.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of Measure I Planning and Allocation Process\n\t \n\t \nOn November 6, 2012, Santa Clara County voters authorized East Side Union High School District to issue general obligation bonds up to $120 million to upgrade computer/science labs; improve security/safety; repair, equip, and construct classrooms/facilities at Andrew Hill, Calero, Evergreen Valley, Foothill, Independence, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, Yerba Buena, W. C. Overfelt, and District adult, alternative, and charter schools; and acquire property for new schools.  \n\t \nMeasure E Historical Perspective\nWhen Measure E was allocated in 2009, an allocation plan was developed that modeled an intersection between academic programs and renovated and newly constructed facilities, technology and equipment that provided the district with an innovative approach to equitably prioritizing resources.  Specific criteria were developed by a team of stakeholders, including the Academic Master Plan working group, district facility staff, Superintendent and cabinet, School Site Councils, and campus administrators.  A Project Ranking & Pricing Process that is standardized, equitable and stakeholder driven was developed based on the Academic Master Plan categories of Health, Safety & ADA, Capacity, Technology, Outdoor / Athletic Spaces, Collaborative Spaces, and Specialty Spaces.  The Academic Master Plan criteria used to establish standardized criteria for ranking projects was used. The criteria was based on consistency of request, reasonable and affordable, impact on the greatest number of students, timing of projects – long & short, addressing the achievement gap, parity and equity, and cost savings measures.  Sources of District and campus needs were based on the Academic Master Plan, Technology Master Plan, Measure G Master Plan, Preliminary Needs Assessment, Maintenance & Operations Deferred Maintenance Plan, and School Site Council priorities (February 19, 2009, Board Item 13.03).\n\t \nIn that Measure E Equity Distribution process, the Board distributed monies to comprehensive high schools based on three weighted criteria:\nAcademic Performance Distribution:  the greatest share was allocated to the lowest academic performers (30%)\nBond Share Distribution:  the greatest share was allocated to campuses that received the least amounts of previous bond measure monies (30%)\nAcademic Master Plan Distribution:  funds were allocated to specific projects based on School Site Council priorities (20%)\n\t \nAdditionally, the Board distributed monies to:\nAlternative Education Distribution (10%)\nTechnology Distribution (10%)\n\t \nBy 2011, $274,585,000 of bonds had been issued; the remaining $74,415,000 could not be issued due to decreases in property values.  In consideration, the Board approved a Phase III Equity Allocation to mitigate disparity, using Fund 35 and Measure G funds (December 8, 2011, Board Item 14.01).  Phases I and II of Measure E projects are still in progress, and to date no work has commenced on Phase III projects.\n\t \nMeasure I Allocation\nIn December 2012, the Board allocated $10,500,000 of Measure I Board discretionary funds to augment the Swimming Pool Upgrade Project (December 11, 2012, Board Item 16.03).  In April 2013, the Board allocated $1,000,000 of Measure I Board discretionary funds for the EduCare Silicon Valley facility (April 16, 2013, Board Item 8.02).\n\t \nIn light of the Measure E history and recent authorizations for use of Measure I Board discretionary funds, the following Measure I allocation model is offered for Board consideration.  \n\t \nMeasure I\n$120,000,000\nBoard discretionary allocation for Swimming Pools Modernization Project\n$  10,500,000\nBoard discretionary allocation for EduCare Silicon Valley Early Learning Career Academy\n$    1,000,000\nBackfill allocations for unissuable Measure E bonds\n$  74,415,000\nDistribution to Sites\n$  34,085,000\n\t \n\t \nUnder this proposed Measure I allocation model:\nMeasure I funds would be used to backfill Board approved site allocations for Measure E.  The proposed use of Measure I to backfill $74,415,000 of unissuable Measure E bonds is not new site allocation; it is a restoration of Board approved allocation from February 2009.  Restoring these funds would facilitate the fulfillment of the original intent of the Board approved site allocations for Measure E.  Refer to Attachment A Capital Improvement Program Budget Overview Summary for a delineation of the sites whose Measure E allocations would be restored; the amounts are listed as “Uncommitted Allocation” for school sites, and as “Land Acquisition” and “Board-Cabinet Contingency” for the District site.  Please note that this Budget Overview Summary is continually updated as completed Measure E projects are closed out and residual budget monies liquidated, which may increase the Uncommitted Allocations at certain sites.  \n$34,085,000 of Measure I funds would be allocated to sites in the coming months, following the same weighted criteria system used in February 2009 for Measure E.  \n$32,100,000 of Measure I funds used to backfill “Land Acquisition” and “Board-Cabinet Contingency” at the District site would be used to fund and supplement infrastructure projects.  \nSince Measure I funds would backfill the $74,415,000 of originally allocated Measure E funds, the “Phase III Equity Allocations” that were Board approved on December 8, 2011, funded by Fund 35 ($2M), Measure G ($2M), State matching funds anticipated in early 2012 ($12M), and State matching funds expected in 2013 ($4M), which were a stopgap measure introduced as a result of the inability to issue the final series of Measure E bonds, could be rescinded; those funds would then be available for District discretionary initiatives.\nFuture Measure E proceeds from bond sales of $74,415,000 in approximately 2020, when property value increases allow for remaining bond issuances, would become Board discretionary funds.\nMeasure I Planning Process\n\t \nAn inclusive and collaborative planning process has already begun, to identify needs and develop recommendations for how to use Measure I allocations.  The process would build upon the planning work completed in 2008/2009 for Measure E, and mimic the planning, recommendation and approval process put in place for Measure E, as follows:\n\t \nHistorical Analysis \nA review of past planning initiatives will be conducted to ascertain projects that were identified, prioritized, and either implemented or deferred; those planning initiatives include the 2004 Facilities Master Plan, facilities condition and infrastructure studies, as well as previous Bond Measures A, G and E plans and outcomes.\n\t \nInfrastructure Condition Studies\nHistorical infrastructure studies and analysis will be supplemented with additional survey work to identify a global infrastructure strategy for long term needs, with associated cost projections.  The highest priority needs should be included on School Site Council Project and Priority Lists for consideration.\n\t \nSchool Site Council Project and Priority Lists \nHistorical analysis reports will be reviewed by District and Site administration, and School Site Councils.  School Site Councils will work with Facilities Planning staff to update their project and priority lists.  Project and priority lists will be informed by recommendations identified through the Strategic Planning Initiative.\n\t \nIf School Site Councils require assistance in this matter, Facilities Planning staff may engage professional service providers (such as master planning architects) for assistance.\n\t \nSuperintendent’s Council Engagement\nSite project and priority lists will be presented by Site Administration and Facilities Planning to Superintendent’s Council for review and recommendation.\n\t \nBoard of Trustees Approval\nOnce School Site Council and Superintendent’s Council are aligned on proposed project and priority lists, they will be presented to the Board of Trustees for approval.\n\t \nTimeline\nThe following timeline is proposed:\n\t \nHistorical analysis:  April - May 2013\nMeasure I Allocation Model development and approval:  April – June 2013\nInfrastructure condition analysis:  May – September 2013\nSchool Site Council project and priority lists:  May - September 2013\nSuperintendent’s Council review and recommendation of School Site Council project and priority lists:  October - November 2013\nBoard of Trustees approval of School Site project and priority lists:  January 2014\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$108,500,000                                                 \n                                                                                               \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure I general obligation bond funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize distribution of $74,415,000 of Measure I funds to backfill unissuable Measure E bonds, and authorize staff to proceed with the Measure I Planning and Allocation Process and timeline delineated in this report.\n",
