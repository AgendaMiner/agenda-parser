Escuela Popular targets new immigrant Spanish speaking students and is a dual language immersion school which emphasizes academic instruction in Spanish in the early years progressing to content delivered in English in later years.  The student population as well as the instructional model made it challenging to find similar schools for data comparisons. The Charter Renewal application from Escuela Popular Accelerated Family Learning Center has been evaluated to ensure that the Charter School complies with all existing and new California laws and regulations, and it has been assessed on both formative and summative aspects of its educational program.  The financial integrity of the Charter School has also been verified.  Attached for review is the compliance matrix and supporting documents, which demonstrates that the requirements for renewal under Education Code section 47607 have been met.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the renewal of Escuela Popular Accelerated Family Learning Center charter.  The charter will be renewed for 5 years and will expire, June 30, 2017.\n",

The program is designed as a one-time cash incentive for eligible classified (non-management) employees.  The requirements for eligibility are similar to those proposed in the certificated supplemental early retirement program (i.e. 15 years or more of continuous service and age 55 or older). There are a total of 114 eligible employees and the program does not require a minimum number of participants.  The incentive program is being proposed as a cash incentive, as opposed to an annuity, because the annuity was not viewed as a viable (cost saving) option for the District. The one-time early retirement cash incentive is designed to provide an eligible classified (non-management) employee with an incentive to retire earlier than they had planned. The classified incentive program is not expected to project any significant savings to the district and is offered as an equitable compromise to the certificated SERP.  The classified one-time incentive program is not projected to result in a loss to the district.  The classified one-time early retirement incentives are as follows: \nRanges  4-11     $3,000 \nRanges  12-16   $4,000\nRanges  18-24   $5,000\nRanges  26-35   $6,000\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNet Savings Undetermined\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund-Benefits\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2011/2012-27 to Authorize and direct the Associate Superintendent, Human Resources, and Associate Superintendent, Business Services to: 1) Execute the Cash Incentive Program and any and all other documents necessary or proper to implement the Program; 2) Execute any and all documents, including any amendment to the Program, necessary or proper to maintain favorable determination of the Program\n",

This threshold will be determined based on the university’s calculated capacity to serve the overall student population, within the principles outlined above.\nThe campus minimum eligibility index for frosh applicants from the local service area will be lower than the minimum eligibility index required for applicants from outside the local service area, thus providing admission preference to applicants from the local area.\nIMPLICATION OF THIS CHANGE: This change replaces SJSU’s long-standing “local area guarantee” at the CSU minimum eligibility level with a “local preference” for admission of applicants from the local service area. It also means that some frosh applicants from the service area who meet CSU minimum eligibility but not the campus-level minimum may be denied admission to SJSU.\nEnsure outreach to communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and historically low rates of college going.\nSJSU will develop a program known as “Spartan Pathways” to serve a limited number of CSU-eligible frosh and transfer applicants who do not meet major or campus minimum admission thresholds.\nAdmissions criteria for applicants will include community involvement/leadership, overcoming significant hardship, and potential for degree completion.\nInitially, a minimum of 100 enrollment spaces will be allotted to Spartan Pathways, split approximately equally between frosh and transfer applicants. Depending on campus capacity, the number of enrollment spaces filled by applicants to the Spartan Pathways program may be higher.\nIMPLICATION OF THIS CHANGE: This program is intended to serve applicants, perhaps from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are likely to have a higher chance of college success than their qualifications would suggest. It provides them with an opportunity for college access based on factors beyond grades and test scores only.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\tIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2011/2012-31 Adopted Admissions Guideline Modifications at San Jose State University.\n",

This approach considered a net reduction in scope for the Measure E Bond Program of $79 Million.\n\t\t\t \nAt its public meeting of March 8, 2012, the Board was informed of options for disposition of the remaining $79 Million in voter approved authorization by Bond Advisor, Dale Scott & Company. Options presented included deferral of an associated bond sale to some future date (when assessed values that underlie a sale had improved), a capital appreciation bond (that would carry high interest), and returning to voters to make up for the devaluation (a process that would require decertification of the remaining authorization under Measure E).  It is in this context that the Board requested staff to compile a listing of projects that would not be completed if no further funding were made available under Measure E.\n\t\t\t \nAccordingly, staff has conducted an analysis, the findings for which are summarized as follows:\n\t\t\t \nA priority list of projects, reflective of this need, was developed by staff, sites, and cabinet and approved by the Board of Trustees in February, 2009. After the completion of Phases I, II, and the above-referenced limited Phase III of the Measure E Program, approximately $190 Million in projects identified under the Board-Approved priority list (which was subject to availability of funds) would remain unfunded. \n\t\t\t \nOptions are available, subject to the Board’s discretion, to move forward to address a limited set of scope capped at $79 Million or the full scope of $190 Million in remaining “Unfunded Projects”.  If the Board elects to proceed with one of these options, the Board may also wish to consider the merits of proceeding to election in 2012 or 2014. A brief presentation (attached) details potential options and some of the implications that may be considered by the Board.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nUp to 190 Million\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees received the report as presented.\n\t \n",
