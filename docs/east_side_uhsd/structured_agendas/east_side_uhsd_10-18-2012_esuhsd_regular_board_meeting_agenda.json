Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Rogelio Ruiz, Legal Counsel, Rehon & Roberts, and Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nApprove Proposed Termination of Professional Services Agreement and Purchase Orders Between East Side Union High School District and Bruce Flyn & Associates, Inc.\n\t \nThe Governing Board previously awarded contracts to Bruce Flyn & Associates, Inc. (“BFAI”) to provide State-mandated inspection services on the District’s Measure E projects.  Most recently, the District entered into contracts with BFAI (see Purchase Order nos. 000208 and 103211) whereby BFAI is providing inspector-of-record services on the District’s James Lick High School New Two-Story Building 500 Project, the Mt. Pleasant High School New Classroom Modernization Project and the Silver Creek High School Multi-Purpose Classroom Project (the “BFAI Contracts”).  \n\t \nThe contracts for those projects each provides that BFAI shall defend, indemnify and hold the District harmless from and against, among other things, any and all claims, loss, cost, damage, injury, expense and liability that arise from or relate to BFAI’s negligent performance of the inspection services, any negligent act or omission of BFAI or its sub consultant(s), and any breach of the respective BFAI Contracts.\n\t \nBFAI has also provided extensive inspection services to the District in the past in connection with previous Measure E and Measure G projects and other Capital Facilities (non-bond) projects.  At this time and for various reasons, forty-five (45) of those projects are lacking final DSA closeout certification (the “uncertified projects”).\n\t \nBFAI has requested that the District agree to terminate the BFAI contracts due to unforeseen personal circumstances relating to the principal of BFAI.  After consultation with Legal Counsel, Administration is willing to recommend termination provided the termination does not impair the District’s indemnity rights and protections under the BFAI contracts, that the termination does not result in any substantial added expense to the District, the termination does not unduly delay any of the projects, and provided the District receives BFAI’s written assurances that BFAI will cooperate with and assist the District in submitting final documentation required from BFAI necessary for final certification for each of the uncertified projects.\n\t \n\t \nLegal Counsel has prepared the attached Termination of Professional Services Agreement which includes each of the above stipulations and protections in favor of the District.  If the Board approves the proposed agreement and termination, Administration has recommended that the inspection services on each of the above projects be awarded to Furman & Associates, Inc. (James Lick High School New Two-Story Building 500 Project), Santa Clara Valley Construction Inspections (SCVCI),  (Mt. Pleasant High School New Classroom Modernization Project), and Santa Clara Valley Construction Inspections (SCVCI),  (Silver Creek High School Multi-Purpose Classroom Project), which actions have been agendized under Item 16.10 for the Board’s separate consideration, discussion and action.  As detailed in that agenda item, each of those inspectors has been actively engaged as an inspector on their respective project identified above since the inception of each project as a District-approved inspector on the project in affiliation with BFAI.  The direct retention of their services by the District will avoid/minimize any disruption to those projects and minimize and/or avoid any additional costs.\n\t \nAgreement forthcoming.\n\t \n\t \nFunding Source:\nMeasure G and Measure E, as applicable\n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nTo be determined\n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposed Termination of Professional Services Agreement and Purchase Orders between the District and Bruce Flyn & Associates, Inc. as presented.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
