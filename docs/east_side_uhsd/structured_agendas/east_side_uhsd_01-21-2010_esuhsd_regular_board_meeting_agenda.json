Supported by the State of California, the State reimbursed classes include: classes for 9th grade students at risk of failing the High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) and for eligible students in Special Education.  The estimated reimbursement from the State is based on 81.16 percent of the 2007-08 funding for Supplemental Instruction.  Additionally, the supplemental Instruction fund is part of the Tier III categorical program, which allows the fund to be “swept” to the help augment the general fund and to allow for greater flexibility in its use by districts.A description of the summer school programs are described below:1.\tLanguage Arts and Math Summer Institute (SMLI)The goals of the SMLI are to prepare students who are not demonstrating sufficient progress towards passing the CAHSEE for success in Algebra 1 and English 1, articulate with feeder school teachers about student achievement and curriculum focused on CAHSEE standards, and to provide professional development on best practices relating to teaching strategies and curriculum designed to prepare students for rigor of high school.2.\tSpecial EducationSpecial Education classes will be offered at IH, MP, OG, and YB High Schools for Special Day Class (SDC) students who qualify for Extended School Year (ESY) services per their IEP.

The purpose of the MOU is to establish a framework of collaboration, as well as articulate specific roles and responsibilities in support of the State in its implementation of an approved Race to the Top grant project.   The Race to the Top Fund provides competitive grants to encourage and reward States that are creating the conditions for education innovation and reform; implementing ambitious plans in the four education reform areas:  1) refine current rigorous state standards; 2) provide new supports for teachers and principals aimed improving effectiveness; 3) enhance local data systems and coordinate those systems with state data systems; and 4) dramatically improve the State’s persistently lowest-achieving schools.  \tUnusual with this grant opportunity has been the short turn around time for LEAs to respond to the State's invitation and a State Plan yet to be completed.  However, the State’s application must describe how the State and its participating LEAs intend to use Race to the Top and other funds to implement comprehensive and coherent policies and practices in the four education reform areas, and how these are designed to increase student achievement, reduce the achievement gap across student subgroups, and increase the rates at which students graduate from high school prepared for college and careers.\tContingent that the State’s Plan is approved, LEAs will have 90 days to complete a detailed “final scope of work.”  It is anticipated that sections of Race to the Top will require collaboration with the East Side Teachers Association (ESTA) that potentially impact bargaining unit members.FISCAL IMPACT:To Be DeterminedFUNDING SOURCE:Race to the TopRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees ratify the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) entered into by and between the State of California and East Side Union High School District.",

The superintendent should be the person and office through which the direction set by the school board is carried out.  The working relationship that develops between the board and superintendent is thus absolutely critical and the selection of the superintendent provides the initial definition to that relationship.  As befits a decision of this importance many districts employ a search firm or consultant to assist in the search.  Attached is a list of actions and activities that typically occur during the selection process which may assist the Board in defining the scope of the tasks to be undertaken by the Board and any selected search firm or consultant.   I have also attached a draft “request for proposals” that can be used to solicit proposals from search firms or consultants to aid the District in selecting a superintendent.  Finally, attached is a list of school districts and their costs for either a state, regional, or nation-wide search.To assist in the selection process of a superintendent California School Boards Association (CSBA) offers a variety of consulting services to assist boards in preparing for and carrying out their own executive search.  The services range from coaching and assisting the board on the complexities of the search process to attending a workshop on how to select a full-service search firm.FISCAL IMPACT:Range of $17,000 to $43,000+FUNDING SOURCE:General FundRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees provide direction to Administration as to the next steps in the selection process of a Superintendent for East Side Union High School District.",

Pleasant High School, Evergreen Valley High School, Yerba Buena High School, Oak Grove High School, Piedmont Hills High School, Andrew Hill High School and Santa Teresa High School sites for the purpose of installing and maintaining cellular and wireless communication antennas.  With the exception of Santa Teresa High School, all of the antennas would be installed on light poles around the football stadiums at each of those campuses.  Other school districts have entered into such agreements as a means of generating lease income including, most recently, San Jose Unified School District.  At the September 17, 2009, Regular Board Meeting, the Board held a public hearing to solicit community input on the potential leasing of District property for such purposes.  Before Administration can fully negotiate any such lease with any proposed lessee the Board must by two-thirds (2/3) vote (4 out of 5 Members) approve a Resolution of intent to lease property and then advertise the notice of the approved resolution locally, including that the District will be accepting offers to lease such property upon minimum rental terms.  The potential leases could generate approximately $200,000 annually, or more.If the Board approves the proposed Resolution, Administration will work with Legal Counsel to develop the preferred form lease agreement for any such transactions.  Any offers to lease would be opened and examined at the time of the February 18, 2010, Regular Board Meeting, and any lease agreements would be subject to final Board approval.FISCAL IMPACT:Lease revenue to be determinedFUNDING SOURCE:N/ARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt this Resolution by a two-thirds (2/3) majority declaring the District's intent to lease District property as described in the Resolution.
