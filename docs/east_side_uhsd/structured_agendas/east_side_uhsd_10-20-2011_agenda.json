Students in foster care are forced to move to different schools and districts because of foster care placement issues.  In some cases, students move multiple times during a given school year. Because these students change schools midway through a semester, they often times are not able to complete a full semester of course work causing these students to fall behind on graduation requirements.\n\t \nThe California Foster Youth Education Task Force met with other state agencies during a Foster Youth Education Summit held in Sacramento and designed a set of recommended practices for Foster Youth and Youth in Transition from juvenile court operated schools and facilities. One of the recommendations is to institute partial credits for students who fall into these categories. Education Code 48645.5 states that districts must accept partial credits earned by these students and the amendment to the East Side Union High School District Board Policy 5120.1 allows East Side schools to issue partial credits to these students when they exit one of our schools.\n\t \nStudent Services and Instructional Services have been meeting with representatives from the Santa Clara County Office of Education, the Santa Clara Juvenile Courts, and other districts to discuss best practices involving students in foster care and students transitioning from the juvenile court system. The group as a whole is urgently recommending the implementation of partial credits for these youth.\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive and review the first reading of amended Board Policy #5120.1 Assignment of Credit.\n\t \n",

Once this occurs, the California Department of Education will approve the request and assign a California Directory of Schools (CDS) number.  This number is required because it identifies the site for funding, reporting, and overall operating purposes.\n\t \nProposed High School: The East Side Union High School District intends to open a new Alternative High School called Calero High School in September 2012 barring any construction delays; otherwise, it will open in January 2013. The school will serve approximately 320 students in an Alternative High School setting, grades 9-12. Enrollment at Calero will be voluntary for both students and staff and will be considered a school of choice.\n\t \nFacilities:  Calero High School will be located at 420 Calero Ave. San Jose, CA 95123. The East Side Union High School District purchased this property in 2008/09 with the intent of opening another high school. The property originally served as an elementary school in the Oak Grove School District. After many years of use by the Oak Grove School District and subsequent occupation by a Santa Clara County Office of Education Community Day School, it was necessary to design an extensive remodel prior to opening a new high school to serve students within the East Side Union High School District. Remodel efforts are underway.\n\t \nProgram Overview: Calero will be an Alternative Education High School which will offer options for students who find the traditional high school environment a challenge. Students are offered small class sizes, individualized attention, and a flexible schedule allowing them to attend CCOC, Community College, and participate in Work Experience. The goal of this program is to graduate students and prepare them for post-secondary educational programs and/or careers. Students will be offered a full range of classes, including self-paced performance-based courses, which will allow students to recover credit and course requirements, accelerate to grade level, and take advanced course work.\n\t \nCalero High School will also offer a Virtual Academy which will utilize an online curriculum allowing students to complete coursework at their own pace so that they can recover credit and graduate at an accelerated rate. Another advantage of this program will be to provide an alternative environment and daily schedule that accommodates the needs of students who cannot attend a comprehensive high school. Students in this program will attend classes for 4 hours per day to receive instruction and individualized help and will continue their study at home in the virtual environment. Two 4 hour sessions accommodating a total of 60 students will rotate through the program each day.\n\t \nAll state-mandated testing such as STAR, CAHSEE, and CELDT will be administered according to state mandates to the appropriate students at Calero High School. The school will seek WASC accreditation during the first year of operation. The school will offer courses approved by the East Side Union High School District which has a full roster of UC/CSU A-G approved courses.\n\t \nStaffing:  The district will begin hiring teachers, administrators, and support staff in late spring or early summer of 2012.\n\t \nBudget: Calero High School will have its own operating budget using the same formulas for funding that are used for the other high schools within the district. The budget will be Board-approved prior to the opening of the school in spring of 2012.\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nAs per salary schedule\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board approve the establishment of a new alternative education high school called Calero High School. \n\t \n",

After evaluating District information, Keenan and Associates recommended parameters for eligibility including a minimum of fifteen (15) years of service and a minimum age of fifty-five (55).  It was shown that at least 209 employees were eligible based on this criteria with the bulk being between the ages of 58 – 64.  If approved, the District would offer an annuity based on 75% of the employee’s salary which will be paid out as an annuity.  The employee can select from a variety of payout options based on the employee’s needs.   \n\t \nThe District has gone beyond the parameters presented by Keenan and Associates to ensure that the assumptions are realistic and that the targeted savings goals are realized. The District’s normal annual attrition for retirees is approximately 22 and the District has established a goal of 85 retirees under the plan. The District realizes that this is a very aggressive target, however, a full analysis will be completed and a final recommendation will be presented to the Board once all SERP enrollment information has been reviewed. \n\t \nA commission amount of 5% would be paid to the plan administrator Keenan and Associates and is based on total premiums included in the plan benefits.  The plan recognizes saving based on a salary differential of a replacement employee.  The plan, as presented, is estimated to generate net cumulative savings to the district of $2.6 million over a 5 year period.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$2.6 million in savings over 5 years (est.)\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund benefit\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2011/2012-08 to authorize and direct Associate Superintendent, Human Resources and Associate Superintendent, Business Services to: 1) Execute the Plan and any and all other documents necessary or proper to implement the Plan;  2) Contract with Keenan Financial Services as contract administrator to provide all services described in the contract at a rate not to exceed 5% of premium costs; 3) Execute any and all documents, including any amendment to the Plan, necessary or proper to maintain favorable determination of the Plan, and  4) Enter into any other contract or agreement which he or she deems necessary or proper to administer and/or fund the Plan and to attain and maintain the income tax qualification of the Plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n",

Since that time, the situation has become more complex and requires more engineering investigation as to why the windows are failing.  The District contacted its’ insurance provider and they recommended (Architectural Testing, Inc.) which is a specialty testing firm with extensive experience in architectural testing to provide testing of the windows, reason for failure, and recommended solutions.  The district has entered into a contract with Architectural Testing and a final report is expected by the end of November 2011.  All purchase orders, contracts, and work related to this matter to date were performed without advertising for, or soliciting, any bids. The district believes that all actions taken to this point constituted an emergency as defined by public contract code 20113.  The district will present findings, recommendations, and follow-up activities to the Governing Board once the results of the architectural testing are complete.  \n\t\t\t \nPublic Contract Code section 20113 authorizes the District, in the case of an emergency and by unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees, and with the approval of the County Superintendent of Schools, to enter into contracts for the performance of labor and the furnishing of materials and supplies for any repairs, alterations, or work of improvements as necessary with regard to the public schools without advertising for or inviting bids.  Administration is requesting that the Board of Trustees approve the attached resolution declaring an emergency and effectively ratify the award of the purchase orders/contracts already issued and for future purchase orders/contracts which may be necessary should the windows failures continue at this location. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nUndetermined at this time\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nUndetermined at this time\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution 2011/2012-09 declaring an emergency situation; ratifying the purchase orders/contracts with Venezia Construction, Architectural Testing, and Lotus Glass; and to authorize Administration to enter into further purchase orders/contracts for the emergency remediation work on the school facilities for health and safety reasons.\n\t \n",

(“Cleary) and authorization of payments to Cleary in the total amount of $30,419.60 in connection with work already performed and being performed under the proposed contract.  Cleary provides geotechnical and engineering geology consulting services to the District, primarily in connection with the District’s Measure G and Measure E bond programs.  Cleary has previously been qualified by the District to provide such services and has been providing such services to the District on a variety of projects for more than 8 years.  \n\t\t\t \nIt has come to Administration’s attention that earlier this year Cleary was requested and authorized by staff to provide geotechnical and engineering geology consulting services on the following projects in the following amounts:\nJames Lick High School New Child Care Center (G-030-027)           $11,957.50\nJames Lich High School New Two Story Bldg 500 (E-030-001)         $  2,236.25\nSilver Creek High School New Multi-Purpose Bldg (E-055-001)        $     883.75\nSanta Teresa High School New Multi-Purpose Bldg (E-070-001)      $15,342.10\nIn accordance with the request, Cleary performed and is still performing the services requested by staff.  To date, those services have been performed satisfactorily by Cleary.  The services provided by Cleary are necessary to the completion to each of the above projects.\n\t\t\t \nNevertheless, the manner and method in which Cleary was retained on the above projects was not in conformance with at least two (2) of the FCMAT recommendations and the administrative and policy changes implemented by Administration and the Board in response to the 2010 FCMAT Extraordinary Audit.  Specifically:\nThere was a failure to implement the informal bidding process specified under the March 1, 2010, Administrative Directive and Administrative Regulation 3311 for the services for which Cleary was ultimately directed to provide, and\nThe contracts with Cleary for these projects were not ever presented to this Board for approval.\nAdministration is undertaking a continuous and focused communications, training and oversight effort to prevent future violations of Board Policy and Administrative Regulations.  This approval is sought and detailed in this manner as part of Administration’s continuing effort to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the District’s contracting practices.\n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$30,419.60\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasures E & G\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and ratify the contracts with Cleary Consultants, Inc. for the services described above in the total amount of $30,419.60.  \n\t \n",
