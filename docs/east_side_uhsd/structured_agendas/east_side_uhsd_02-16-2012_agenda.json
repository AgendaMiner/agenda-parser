The project initial infrastructure expense is expected to cost $675,000 and would not require any outlay from the District.  Chevron has arranged for low cost financing which will provide a benefit to the District in preserving its cash.  \n\t\t\t \nIn order to move forward, the district must complete the application and cash reservation process to officially reserve the incentive (CSI) funding by making a deposit of $5,000 to PG&E by the February 17, 2012 deadline.   \n\t \n",

Overfelt High School due to a main water pipe breakage which left the school with no running water.  The school had taken attendance for 145 instructional minutes.  The attendance was below the statutory minimum day requirement of 180 minutes which resulted in the California Department of Education denying the attendance allowance waiver request that the District submitted.\n\t\t\t\t \nA revision was advised by California Department of Education to resubmit the J-13A to request a “one day” attendance waiver for a school emergency closure, since W.C. Overfelt H.S. did not achieve the minimum attendance allowance of 180 minutes requirement.\n\t\t\t\t \nThe affidavit and supporting documents, if approved by County Superintendent, will be forwarded to the School Fiscal Services Division of the California Department of Education.   \n\t\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attendance waiver for the Emergency \"One-Day\" School Closure for W.C.
