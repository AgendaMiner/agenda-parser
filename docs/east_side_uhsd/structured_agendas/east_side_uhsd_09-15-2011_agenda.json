Calero High School will operate a morning and an afternoon session, which offers the District double the normal capacity of classroom usage and consolidates the classroom space.\n\t \nCalero High School will be comprised of seventeen (17) total classrooms including standard classrooms, a science and laboratory classroom, a computer room/library, a multi-purpose room and administrative office space. The 10.08 acre site is occupied by a 38,772 square foot two story school building, two parking lots, and outdoor play fields and associated landscaping. The total floor area is 38,272 square feet. The existing staff parking lot (Lots A and B) provide 49 total spaces.\n           \nThe existing building foot print is not being expanded. The construction and site improvements include the following features:\nExpansion of  staff parking Lot A  from 24 spaces to 54 spaces\nExpansion of staff  parking  Lot B from 25 spaces to 54 spaces\nConstruction of a 39,029 square foot parking lot providing for 97 student parking spaces (Lot C)\nRemodel and reconfiguration of administrative office/school entry\nClassroom improvements\nReconfiguration of the bus loading area\nRefurbished and reconfigured paved play areas\nNew landscaping, sidewalks, fencing and signage\nThe extension of utilities and associated site work\nThe new parking Lot C will be constructed adjacent to Lot A with access from Calero Avenue. The new parking lot will cover an existing league baseball field, which will be relocated just south of the new parking lot, mid-parcel along the eastern edge of the school site. The baseball field at the southeastern corner of the site will be refurbished as follows:  skin the infield, add dug-out benches, replace the backstop and chain link safety fencing where needed. The construction and the improvements to the baseball fields are not components of the East Side Union High School District bond measure project; it is under the purview of the baseball league.\n\t \nA necessary aspect of this project is compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The primary purpose of CEQA is to inform decision makers of the environmental consequences of their actions through the completion of an initial study and environmental evaluation of potential impacts, and to identify and mitigation measures that will be employed.\n\t \nAn initial study was prepared for the Calero High School Modernization Project in conformance with the requirements of CEQA.

Within 30 days of receiving a charter school petition, the District is required, pursuant to Education Code Section 47605(b) to “hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the governing board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district, and parents.” Upon receipt of the Petition, the District entered into an agreement with representatives from CREA to extend the timeline for conducting the public hearing an additional 60-days, given that the next Board meeting was scheduled for August 30, 2011. Accordingly, the District held a public hearing on the Petition during the public session portion of its regularly scheduled Board meeting on August 30, 2011.\n\t \nNo District employees, members of the public, or representatives from CREA Green Technology Academy spoke at the hearing in support of the charter school.  \n\t \nBoard Decision to Grant Or Deny Petition Must Be Based On Specific Factual Findings\nThe District must take action to either grant or deny the charter at its September 15, 2011 Board meeting.  The District may grant the charter “if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice.”  The District may not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\n\t \n1.  The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\n2.  The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition;\n3.  The petition does not contain the required number of signatures;\n4.  The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the required conditions set forth in Section 47605(d); or\n5.  The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\n\t \n     (a) Educational Programs;\n     (b) Measurable pupil outcomes;\n     (c) Measurement of Students Progress;\n     (d) Governance Structure Progress;\n     (e) Employee qualifications;\n     (f) Procedures to Ensure Health and safety;\n     (g) Racial and Ethnic Balance;\n     (h) Admission Requirements;\n     (i) Financial Accountability and Audits;\n     (j) Student Suspension/Expulsion Procedures;\n     (k) Retirement System;\n     (l) Student Attendance Alternatives;\n     (m) Employee Rights;\n     (n) Dispute Resolution;\n     (o) Exclusive Public School Employer; and\n     (p) School Closure Protocol.\n\t   \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThere will be a fiscal impact.  The anticipated fiscal impact is not subject to quantification at this time due to the significant uncertainties in the actual charter operations and the extent to which the charter school draws upon non-reimbursable District services.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees give careful consideration to this Petition and the concerns raised by the Charter Petition Review Team.  If the Board acts to deny the Petition, the Board should adopt the attached Charter Petition Review Team Report and the findings included therein.  \n \n\t \n",

The original CM Pool was established at the March 10, 2009 Board Meeting where by four Construction Management firms were selected and approved. However, since that time it has been determined by Administration that having more CM’s in the pool would benefit ESUHSD so as not to over burden any one firm at any one time.\n\t\t \nAfter an extensive evaluation of the proposals submitted and oral interviews with each of the seven new proposers, the following listed firms are recommended to provide construction management services for the ESUHSD’s Measure E and G Bond Construction and Capital Improvement Programs and any other projects that require such services.  As projects come up all firms in the Pre-Approved CM Pool will be requested to submit a separate cost proposal and will be awarded projects based on their proposals.\nBlach Construction Company (Existing)\nFacilities Management Planning and Operations – FMPO (Existing)\nSGI Construction Management – Seville Group (Existing)\nO’Connor Construction Management (Existing)\nTBI Construction & Construction Management, Inc. (New)\nRGM and Associates (New)\nVan Pelt Construction Services (VPCS) (New)\nCambridge CM. Inc. (New)\nKitchell (New)\nUnited Compliance Corporation (New)\nThe District underwent a thorough Request for Statement of Qualification (RFQ) process (RFQ-03-11-12). The RFQ was released on August 04, 2011 and closed on August 18, 2011. The RFQ was advertised on August 08, 2011 and August 15, 2011. The District received eleven (11) responsive and responsible proposals.\n\t\tThe first step in the evaluation process was to evaluate each of the eleven proposals submitted to the District. The four (4) current (CM) firms were only asked to update the District of any change in their organization or information that they want to include.  The current (CM) firms were not required to go through the evaluation process and I interviews.  A committee was established and a rating sheet prepared for their evaluation of the written proposal. The committee consisted of Tom Herrington \n(Substitute Director of Facilities), Donna Bertrand, C.P.M. (Contract Administration Coordinator), Grettel Castro-Stanley (Principal), Mac Cage (Interim Director of Information Technology Services), Edward Bright, (Grounds Lead) and Janice Unger (Capital Projects Purchasing Manager).\nSeven CM firms were then recommended to move forward to the oral interview based on the scores of the written proposal evaluation. The oral interviews were conducted with the same panel members.  All CM firms were scored on their presentations and responses to District questions.\n\t\tThe third and final step in the evaluation process was to call the references. The references were asked to rate the past performances of the seven CM firms using a scale of 1-10.\n\t\tAll of the scores were added together to form the final recommendation that would be taken to the Board of Trustee, which is presented herein.\n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the following recommendations for the \"Measure E & G\" Pre-Approved Construction Management Firms (CM) List.\n\t \n",
