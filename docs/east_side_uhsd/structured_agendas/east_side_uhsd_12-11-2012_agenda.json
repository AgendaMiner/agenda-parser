Pursuant to Education Code 47605, a public hearing is required within thirty (30) days following the submission of a renewal charter school petition to the district.  The renewal petition was submitted to the Board on October 18, 2012.\n\t \nDuring the Public Hearing, the Governing Board of the school district considered the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents. The public hearing was held during the November 15, 2012 meeting where KIPP gave a presentation and had many supporters in attendance.   The Governing Board shall either grant or deny the charter renewal within sixty (60) days of receipt of the petition. The decision will be made at the December 11, 2012 Board Meeting.\n\t \nKIPP San Jose Collegiate is a 9th through 12th grade school, with a focus on college readiness.  KIPP serves about 400 students from diverse backgrounds with 95% minority students and 70% qualify for free or reduced lunch.  KIPP first opened its doors in East Side in 2008 and is going through their first renewal.  One hundred percent of the class of 2012 were college ready and 95% were accepted to a four year postsecondary institution.\n\t \nA team of district experts from the Instructional Division, Business Division, and Human Resources Division reviewed the charter renewal proposal and visited the school site. Their findings are included in the renewal matrix. \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the renewal of KIPP San Jose Collegiate charter.  The charter will be renewed for 5 years and will expire, June 30, 2018.\n",

Pleasant and Overfelt High Schools, budgeted at $5.23 million.  The intent of the project was to perform basic repairs as delineated in the 2004 Facilities Master Plan. Arch Pac Aquatics was engaged to develop construction drawings and specifications. This is the same aquatics subconsultant that the Facilities Master Plan firm Perkins & Will used to analyze and scope pool conditions back in 2004; in addition, Arch Pac Aquatics was the architect of record for the Oak Grove Pool Renovation in 2004.\n\t\t \nThe first phase of pools to be renovated under the current project is at Independence and Yerba Buena. The District received construction bids for the Independence High School pool upgrade in late October; the bids significantly exceeded the construction budget.  Staff has performed due diligence by examining the bidders' proposals, identifying construction costs for similar pool renovations at other school districts, and receiving revised cost estimates from Arch Pac.  The established budget of $5.23 million to upgrade the eight pool sites is inadequate.  Staff has identified several options for consideration, including options to renovate pools at fewer sites within the established budget, as well as options to augment the budget so that the original intent of upgrading all eight pool sites can be achieved.  Staff will present the options for the Board’s consideration.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$10.5 million\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure I Board Discretionary\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees provide direction on their preferred swimming pool upgrade project option.\n\t \n",
