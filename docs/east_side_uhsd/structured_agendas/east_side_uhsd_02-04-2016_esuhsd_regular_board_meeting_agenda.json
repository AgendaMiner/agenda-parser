At the November 19 Regular Board Meeting, the Board approved Administration undertaking specific tasks in furtherance of the continued study of the potential development and/or redevelopment of the Education Center property, with quarterly progress updates to the Board and provided that no bond funds are spent in performing the tasks.  \n\t \nAlso at the November 19 Board meeting, Administration presented for Board consideration a proposed lease agreement with KIPP Bay Area Schools for the provision of Proposition 39 Charter School Facilities at the Independence High School site.  The Board did not take any action on the proposed agreement at that time and directed Administration to review and consider the intensity of use of the Independence campus facilities and the impact and potential impacts to students and staff and the District’s education program of shared use of the Independence facilities with charter schools.\n\t \nAdministration met with Independence High School staff, students and community members and other stakeholders on January 25, 2016, to receive input and concerns regarding the use of the Independence facility and long-term needs and planning for that site.  \n\t \nIn light of the issues and concerns raised, Administration is considering long and short-term strategies and opportunities to reduce the intensity of use at the Independence High School site to increase availability of the facilities resources for use by Independence students and staff and to enhance the overall campus atmosphere.  \n\t \nThe Administration proposes to enter into discussions and negotiations with KIPP San Jose Collegiate charter school for a Proposition 39 lease agreement for a portion of the Education Center property for the construction of public high school facilities to relocate the KIPP charter school from the Independence High School site, and to enter into discussions with the County of Santa Clara and other responsible public agencies for the possible development of a portion of the public lands adjacent to the Education Center property to accommodate and support physical education activities and school-related athletic activities.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTo Be Determined\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nTo Be Determined\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAdministration recommends that the Board authorize and approve the following:\n\t \nAuthorize Superintendent or his designee(s) to enter into discussions and negotiations with KIPP San Jose Collegiate charter school for a Proposition 39 ground lease agreement for a portion of the Education Center property for the construction of public charter high school facilities by KIPP to relocate the KIPP charter school from the Independence High School site to the Education Center property; and\n\t\t \nAuthorize Superintendent or his designee(s) to enter into discussions with the County of Santa Clara and other responsible public agencies for the possible development of a portion of the public lands adjacent to the Education Center property to accommodate and support physical education activities and school-related athletic activities.\n\t \n",

Overfelt High School Music, Art and Administration Building and Central Quad Modernization Project will Reduce Project Costs, Expedite the Project’s Completion, or Provide Features Not Achievable Through the Design-Bid-Build Process\n\t\t \n\t\t \nOn September 17, 2015, the Board of Trustees approved the W.C. Overfelt High School Music, Art and Administration Building and Central Quad Modernization Project, to be funded by Measure E Board/Cabinet Contingency funds (Item 15.01). On February 14, 2013, the Board considered public works construction project delivery methods available for this project, including design-bid-build, design-build, energy service contracting, and lease lease-back.  \n\t\t \nFor this project, District staff has examined possible construction delivery methods and has concluded that the use of design-build delivery for the project offers the following potential advantages to the District not available under a traditional design-bid-build delivery method:\n\t\t \nSimplified contracting and contract administration:  There is one contract with the design-build entity instead of separate contracts with an architect and a contractor.   This reduces administrative burden and associated costs.\nCost containment:  The design-build entity is under a contract to complete the project meeting the District’s stated requirements within the contract price.\nCost savings:  Innovative, cost-effective solutions meeting performance criteria can be achieved by collaboration between the designer and builder, adding construction practicality to design imagination.  The builder is involved in the design process from the beginning and can provide helpful insights on construction materials and methods that can make the design more efficient and less costly to construct, operate and maintain. \nEarly cost definition:  Project costs are determined much sooner than with the traditional design-bid-build process.   The design-build method enables the District to determine the cost of the project upon award of the design-build contract instead of after Division of the State Architect approval and construction contract bidding.   This early cost knowledge allows the District to make informed decisions on detailed scope in order to ensure equity of outcomes among the school sites.\nReduced number of change orders and disputes:  Because the designer and builder are part of the same design-build entity, and the District is not the guarantor of the completeness and accuracy of the work of the architect/engineer, the District may avoid conflicts and disputes, and the corresponding costs of those conflicts and disputes that can arise between the architect/engineer and construction contractor.\nGreater risk shifting and more efficient risk allocation:  The vesting of design and construction functions under one entity enables proper allocation of risk under the design-build contract, because the contractor’s involvement in constructability review and existing site condition surveys during preconstruction activities reduces or eliminates the need for redesign during the construction phase. \nReduction in adversarial relationships:  The designer and builder are teamed together, working under a single contract.  This teaming can significantly reduce traditional conflicts and finger-pointing between designer and contractor, and eliminate the need for the District to referee disputes.\nTime savings:  The design-build entity is allowed the freedom to explore time-saving construction methods or systems while meeting the District’s stated criteria.  Early coordination between the designer and builder can help prevent construction delays.   Additionally, by overlapping design and construction to some extent, design-build can deliver the project faster than the design-bid-build approach.  Any and all of these elements can accelerate delivery of the new Student Union and modernized Quad.\nAlternative selection process: Design-build entities may be selected on the basis of factors other than price alone.  Design-build entities can assemble a team of architects, engineers, subcontractors and suppliers with whom they have had previous successful collaborations, and that reflect the goals and needs of the project.  The District can select the winning team based on not only price, but also other factors including technical expertise, life cycle cost over 15 years or more, skilled labor force availability, safety record, successful previous experience, project-specific plans and schedules, design, and other qualitative elements.\n\t\t \nEducation Code §17250.20 stipulates that upon making a determination by the governing board that it is in the best interest of the District, the Board may enter into a design-build contract for both the design and construction of a school facility if that expenditure exceeds two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) if, after evaluation of the traditional design, bid, and build process of school construction and of the design-build process in a public meeting, the governing board makes written findings that use of the design-build process on the specific project under consideration will accomplish one of the following objectives:  reduce comparable project costs, expedite the project's completion, or provide features not achievable through the traditional design-bid-build method.  The governing board also shall review the guidelines developed pursuant to Education Code §17250.40 (Attachment A) and shall adopt a resolution approving the use of a design-build contract pursuant to this chapter prior to entering into a design-build contract.\n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \nNot applicable
