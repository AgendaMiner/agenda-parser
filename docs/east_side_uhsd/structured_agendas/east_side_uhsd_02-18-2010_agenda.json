In addition to past successes and the positive impact of the program for the past five years, numerous concerns were expressed regarding the administrative management and oversight of the program.   Areas of concerns included:  lack of adequate funding; appropriate scheduling of classes; master scheduling errors; reductions in the coordinator’s time; lack of time to prepare the five-year study, and concerns regarding the continuance of the program.  In response to these concerns, many parents of IB students have formed a parents group in order to support the program at Andrew Hill High School.  Notwithstanding these challenging budget times, Board members and the Acting Superintendent reiterated their commitment for the program. At the request of the Board of Trustees the Board President and Acting Superintendent met with the newly formed parent group on October 27, 2009 to follow up on concerns and establish a dialog.  Before the meeting, the school administration provided an update on the IB Program and its overall impact on school. This presentation was followed by a meeting at which parents expressed concerns focusing on the continuance of the program and the level of funding provided.  Once again a commitment to the program was expressed by the district.   Parents were open to the communications and willing to work towards a common solution. Over the succeeding weeks it became apparent that an outside unbiased person was needed to help the healing process.

Superintendents, assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, special education and adult education leaders, curriculum and assessment leaders, school business officials, classified educational leaders, and other school district employees are considered administrators; andWHEREAS, providing quality service for student success is paramount for the profession; andWHEREAS, Most school administrators began their careers as teachers. The average administrator has served in public education for more than a decade. Most of California’s superintendents have served in education for more than 20 years. Such experience is beneficial in their work to effectively and efficiently lead public education and improve student achievement; andWHEREAS, Public schools operate with lean management systems. Across the nation, public schools employ fewer managers and supervisors than most public and private sector industries including transportation, food service, manufacturing, utilities, construction, publishing and public administration; andWHEREAS, School leaders depend on a network of support from school communities – fellow administrators, teachers, parents, students, businesses, community members, board trustees, colleges and universities, community and faith-based organizations, elected officials and district and county staff and resources – to promote ongoing student achievement and school success; andWHEREAS, Research shows great schools are led by great principals, and great districts are led by great superintendents. These site leaders are supported by extensive administrative networks throughout the state; andWHEREAS, the State of California has declared the first full week of March as the “Week of the School Administrator” in Education Code 44015.1; andWHEREAS, The future of California’s public education system depends upon the quality of its leadership; now thereforeTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the East Side Union High School District that all school leaders be commended for the contributions they make to successful student achievement.PASSED AND ADOPTED this 18th day of February, 2010 by the Governing Board of the East Side Union High School District at its regular meeting held at 830 N.

WHEREAS, the U.S. immigration system is broken and requires practical solutions that benefit all residents of the United States such as earned legalization, security focusing on real threats, family reunification, fair treatment of workers, immigrant integration, guaranteed due process for all, and a safety net for the most vulnerable.WHEREAS, an estimated 12 million residents of the United States are living in the shadows of society severed from life’s activities that the average American takes for granted, including authorization to work, the right to drive, access to a safety net in times of need, access to loans for higher education, the right to travel, reunification with immediate family members, the right to vote, service on juries, access to federal jobs, and many other human needs that are essential to healthy families and healthy communities.  This includes approximately 65,000 undocumented high school students, including valedictorians, top scholars, and talented athletes, who are denied the right to develop their talents and potential solely because of their legal status.  In Santa Clara County, tens of thousands of “mixed status” families with US citizen families find themselves with little opportunity and hope under our current immigration system.  WHEREAS, outdated family immigration channels keep close family members separated for decades and must be reformed to restore our commitment to promoting family unity. Those stuck in endless “backlogs” should have their admission expedited, and those admitted on work visas should be able to keep their nuclear families intact.WHEREAS, a rational and humane approach to the undocumented population should be taken by creating a rigorous registration process that leads to lawful permanent resident status and eventual citizenship. The registration program should include reasonable submission to background checks, paying taxes, and studying English. WHEREAS, the Federal government should help new immigrants learn the language and laws of the United States, ensure equal opportunity for immigrants to participate in programs and services, and support state and local governments’ efforts to help integrate these new Americans. WHEREAS, the Constitution guarantees due process for all people in this country.  Congress must restore basic civil liberties for all individuals in the United States and renew our commitment to core American values of fairness and justice.NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the East Side Union High School District supports the reform for immigration. As a participant, East Side Union High School District pledges to take a leadership role in promoting public awareness about the urgent need for just and humane immigration reform.

A parcel is defined as any unit of land in the District that receives a separate tax bill from the Santa Clara County Assessor’s Office.  Any property that would otherwise be exempt from property taxes is also exempt from the qualified special tax.  Local parcel taxes provide one way for school districts to fund a wide array of operational and programmatic needs of an educational entity.Because of the reduction in state funding and the continuing unstable state economic climate, the East Side Union High School District is facing a huge deficit for the next school year and future years.  To assist the District in continuing its mission to provide an exemplary educational program for our students, Administration recommends that the Board of Trustees explore the feasibility of placing a parcel tax on the November 2010 ballot in an upcoming election.  Consistent with the Board President’s remarks at the State of the District address, the District would need to analyze the appropriate level of parcel tax that would generate the widest support, as well as a framework for citizen oversight.Recommendation:The Board authorize and direct administration to explore the feasibility of a parcel tax measure for the November 2010 General Election and that the administration submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees for consideration at the March 4, 2010, Regular Board Meeting.

For the 2010-2011 school year, ESUHSD will be designated 120 allotments.Selection Process There was no competitive solicitation done for this service.  The Santa Clara County Office of Education operates community schools which provide services for students of school districts throughout Santa Clara County. RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve a Contract Services Agreement with the Santa Clara County Office of Education for the contract term July 1, 2010 through and including June 30, 2011 for the provision of Community School Services for East Side Union High School District.3.

BertrandNovember 20, 2009 - August 31, 2010$423,000.00 (increase amount)Title ITim NguyenThe District is requesting authorization from the Board of Trustees to issue Amendment #1 to Contract Services Agreement with Extreme Learning for the contract term November 20, 2009 through and including August 31, 2010 for the provision of supplemental educational Services to Title I Students at Program Improvement Year 2+ Schools; Andrew Hill, Independence, James Lick High Schools W.C. Overfelt, and Oak Grove High Schools. Reason for the Amendment.Title I requires that the parents are to decide which Supplementary Educational Service (SES) providers they want for their children.  Title I requires ESUHSD to use their State approved SES providers list to select the providers to be used at ESUHSD along with the help of the parents.  These contracts are paid for out of Title I funds.  Some of these providers are a 1 to 1, some are 5 to I.  The State allows home, off site, or on site services. The original Contract Services Agreement was approved by the Board of Trustees at the November 19, 2009 Board meeting in the amount of $92,300.  The original Contract was based on the first enrollment window which took place in October 2009.  Since that time two additional schools entered Program Improvement Year II status (W.C. Overfelt and Oak Grove High Schools) thereby making their Title I students eligible for SES services.  Due to the open enrollment process for these two new schools, the law requires that the enrollment period be reopened to the first three schools.  Therefore, due to the fact that 353 new parent requests for SES services came out of the second enrollment period and that each student will receive a free Netbook cost for this contract has increased significantly. Selection Process N/A RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Amendment #1 with Extreme Learning for the contract term July 1, 2009 through and including June 30, 2010 for the provision of supplemental educational services to Title I students at Program Improvement year 2+ schools.",
