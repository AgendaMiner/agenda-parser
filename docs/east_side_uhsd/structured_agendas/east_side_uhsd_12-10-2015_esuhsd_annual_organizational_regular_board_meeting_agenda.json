Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nGlenn Vander Zee, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Kirsten King, Director of Assessment & Accountability, and Lucretia Peebles, Ph.D., Administrator for Charter School Oversight\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Approve or Deny Latino College Preparatory Academy Charter School Renewal Petition\n\t \nI. Brief Introduction and Summary or Recommendation\nOn October 9, 2015, Julie Thompson, Director of Compliance & Teacher Development for The Foundation for Hispanic Education, submitted a petition (“Petition”) dated October 8, 2015, seeking renewal of the charter. Latino College Preparatory Academy is a 9-12 school with a current enrollment of 422 students. The East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) approved the current Latino College Preparatory Academy (LCPA) charter on March 24, 2011, for a five-year term, from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016. This will be the third renewal for LCPA. The first renewal by the Board occurred on April 6, 2006, and the second renewal occurred on March 24, 2011. Both renewals carried five-year terms.\n\t \nOn November 3, 2015, Staff visited Latino College Preparatory Academy to observe classrooms and met with parents, teachers, students and administrators, and participated in a teleconference with representatives from The Foundation for Hispanic Education’s Charter School Committee, charged with oversight of Latino College Preparatory Academy. East Side Union High School District Staff from the areas of Human Resources, Attendance Accounting and Facilities met with their respective counterparts at LCPA and found these areas to be satisfactory. Overall, the visit provided evidence that LCPA is implementing the educational program for which it was approved. \n\t \nStaff reviewed the Petition for Latino College Preparatory Academy utilizing the criteria for charter approval set forth in Education Code Section 47605. Charter renewal is “governed by the standard and criteria set forth in Education Code Section 47605.” Through this report, Staff provides the Board with an assessment of the sufficiency of the Petition with respect to the criteria for approval.  Staff recommends that the Board review Staff’s analysis with respect to these criteria and make a finding regarding whether each criterion for approval has been satisfied.\n\t \nProcedural Requirements\n\t \nThe East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) received the Latino College Preparatory Academy Petition on October 15, 2015, during a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board held a public hearing on the Petition on November 19, 2015, to consider the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents. The Board will make a decision about whether to renew the charter on December 10, 2015. Education Code Section 47607 (a) (1) stipulates that “each renewal shall be for a period of five years.”\n\t \nCalifornia Education Code Section 47605(b) requires that “following the review of the petition and the public hearing, the governing board of the school district shall either grant or deny the charter within 60 days of receipt of the petition, provided, however, that the date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension.” \n\t \nCriteria for Approval of Charter Renewal Petitions\n\t \nEducation Code section 47605 establishes the requirements a petitioner must satisfy in order for his or her petition for renewal of the charter school to be approved. \n\t \nEducation Code section 47605 (b) provides that the governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\nThe charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\nThe petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\nThe petition does not contain the number of parent or teacher signatures required by Education Code section 47605 (A)-(B).  \nThe petition does not contain an affirmation that the charter school “shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis” pursuant to [Education Code] Section 220 of “disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance….”\nThe petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\nA description of the educational program of the school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an “educated person” in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\nThe measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school. \nThe method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured.\nThe governance structure of the school, including, but not limited to the process to be followed by the school to ensure parental involvement.\nThe qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the school.\nThe procedures that the school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. \nThe means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted.\nAdmission requirements, if applicable.\nThe manner in which annual, independent, financial audits shall be conducted, in accordance with regulations established by the State Board of Education, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved.\nThe procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled.\nThe manner by which staff members of the charter schools will be covered by the State Teachers' Retirement System, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or federal social security.\nThe public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the school district who choose not to attend charter schools.\nA description of the rights of any employee of the school district upon leaving the employment of the school district, to work in a charter school, and of any rights of return to the school district after employment at a charter school.\nThe procedures to be followed by the charter school and the entity granting the charter to resolve disputes relating to the provisions of the charter.\nA declaration whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public school employer of the employees of the charter school for the purposes of the Educational Employment Relations Act.\nA description of the procedures to be used if the charter school closes. The procedures shall ensure a final audit of the school to determine the disposition of all assets and liabilities of the charter school, including plans for disposing of any net assets and for the maintenance and transfer of pupil records.\nReview of the Petition\nStaff reviewed the Petition for Latino College Preparatory Academy utilizing the criteria for charter approval and renewal set forth in East Side Union High School District Board Policy 0420.4 and California Education Code Section 47605. Staff’s assessment of the information provided in the Petition with respect to each of the criterion in Education Code Section 47605 is set forth below and on the attached East Side Union High School Staff Charter School Review Matrix (Appendix A). \n\t \nRequired Elements and Findings in Accordance with Education Code Section 47605(b)\nEducational Program\nStaff finds that the Petition contains a sufficient description of the educational program.\nAbility to Successfully Implement the Program Set Forth in the Petition\nStaff finds no facts that demonstrate the petitioner is unlikely to successfully implement the program.\nRequired Parent or Teacher Signatures \nStaff finds that the request for renewal does not require new signatures be gathered. The original signatures presented for Latino College Preparatory Academy are valid.\nRequired Affirmations \nStaff finds that the Petition contains all of the required affirmations.\nComprehensive Descriptions  \n\t \nStaff finds that the Petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements, except the following:\n\t \na.   Governance Structure of School listed in the section above at D: \n\t \nStaff found that the Petition contained inconsistencies regarding the governing body for the charter school.\n\t \nStaff found that the Petition does not state that the East Side Union High School District Board is entitled to a “single representative on the board of directors of the nonprofit benefit cooperation” (Education Code Section 47604 (b)).  \n\t \nStaff found absent from the petition the Conflict of Interest Code.\n\t \nb.   Health and Safety listed in the section above at F:\n      \nStaff found insufficient the process for the administration of medications, immunizations and health screenings and staff training on emergency and first aid response. \n\t \nc.   Admissions Requirements listed in the section above at H:\n\t \nStaff found the timeline for admissions and enrollment was not specified\n\t \nStaff found the information pertaining to health care coverage and enrollment assistance specified in AB 2706 was not included in the admissions and enrollment application.\n\t \nd.   Pupil Suspension and Expulsions listed in the section above at J:\n\t \nStaff found insufficient information regarding how the resident school district will be involved in disciplinary matters specified in Education Code 47605 (d) (3). \n\t \nFinancial Plan \n\t \nStaff determined that the financial plan is sufficient and requested to have the student growth projections upon which the revenue assumptions have been based. \n\t \nAny Other Criteria Set Forth in Statute\n\t \nRacial and Ethnic Balance\nThe Education Code for charter approval addresses racial balance in two separate criteria.\nEducation Code Section 47605 (d) (1) states: “In addition to any other requirement imposed under this part, a charter school shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Section 220“(e.g., ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability).                                                                  \nEducation Code Section 47605(b)(5)(G) requires that the charter petition contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the “means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted.”\nPreference for Serving Academically Low Achieving Students\nCalifornia Education Code 47605 (h) states: “In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools within the school district, the governing board of the school district shall give preference to petitions that demonstrate the capability to provide comprehensive learning experiences to pupils identified by the petitioner or petitioners as academically low achieving pursuant to the standards established by the State Department of Education under Section 54032.” The renewal petition does not target or focus on recruiting or serving “academically low achieving students” and consequently should not be given preference for approval.\n\t \nV.   Charter School Performance Data\n\t \nAcademic Performance\nEducation Code Section 47605 (c) (1) requires that charter schools “meet all statewide standards” and participate in the statewide assessment system. Education Code Section 47607 (3) (A) makes clear that the most important factor that the Board must consider in making a charter renewal decision is “increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school.” \n\t \nFederal and state accountability is changing with the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Both of these things need to be considered when viewing the student achievement. LCPA was in Program Improvement (PI) for the last 3 years but federal NCLB targets increased to the point where all schools in the state missed PI targets in 2014-15 so this is not a concern for the evaluation of LCPA. While LCPA scored below the district average on the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) the fact that their target population is English Language Learners, which in the ESUHSD also score below the district average, must be considered. Therefore, while this target is below the district average, it is not a concern. Smarter Balanced Assessment results are below the district average however, they are in line with comparison schools when looking at the same target. Thus the student achievement at LCPA is acceptable\n\t \nEligibility for Renewal Findings\n\t \nLatino College Preparatory Academy is in its fifth year or operation on the current charter term. Education Code Section 47607 (b) establishes a minimum standard that a charter school that has been in operation for four years must meet prerequisite to renewal. The charter school shall meet at least one of the following criteria prior to receiving a charter renewal:\nAttained its Academic Performance Index (API) growth target in the prior year or in two of the last three years, or in the aggregate for the prior three years.\nRanked in deciles 4 to 10, inclusive, on the API in the prior year or in two of the last three years.\nRanked in deciles 4 to 10, inclusive, on the API for a demographically comparableschool in the prior year or in two of the last three years.\nThe entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performanceof the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend, as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school.”\n\t \nAs per Education Code § 47607 (B) (i), this determination is to be based on “clear and convincing data.” Based on the shift to Common Core State Standards and the revamping of the state accountability system, four of the above-listed data points are no longer available. East Side Union High School District has determined that Option #4 is the only criteria that can be calculated at this time.\nData on Graduation Rates, Dropout Rates, Graduates completing UC/CSU A-G course requirements, Advanced Placement, and Smarter Balanced Grade 11 assessment results (See Appendix B) were used to compare the student achievement overall, and for student subgroups, for students attending Latino College Preparatory Academy with students at the 4 comparison schools, Independence High School, James Lick High School, Mt. Pleasant High School, and W.C. Overfelt High School. The data show that in some instances students at the comparison schools out score students at LCPA and in some instances LCPA students out score students at the comparison schools. But in general students attending Latino College Preparatory Academy achieve comparable to students attending the comparison schools. Thus LCPA qualifies to submit a charter renewal petition per Education Code 47607(b).\n\t \nEast Side Union High School District Monitoring\n\t \nAn East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) team which includes representatives from Educational Services, Business Services, Special Services, Human Resources, and the Facilities conducts a compliance oversight review of the charter schools each year. The monitoring includes site visits, document reviews and a review of the school’s website. A follow-up review is conducted in the spring to ensure that issues identified as non-compliant are satisfactorily resolved. The annual monitoring reviews have found Latino College Preparatory Academy to be compliant in the implementation of the education program, including offering its students, UC a-g approved courses. Areas of noncompliance have been identified in the school governance at it pertains to the availability of minutes its board meetings (Charter School Committee), roster of the governing board members, board composition. Additional areas of noncompliance have included inclusion of health and safety information in the Student Handbook, staffing classrooms with qualified teachers with the required authorizations, instituting a process for the verification of weekly student attendance reports, and submission of Certificates of Occupancy and the Conditional Use Permit. The school has responded by satisfactorily addressing noted areas of noncompliance. \n\t \nFinancial Performance\nThe Latino College Preparatory Academy annual independent audits conducted by Berger Lewis Accountancy Cooperation Certified Public Accountants and Business Advisory, for the years ending June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2013 and by Vincenti, Lloyd & Stutzman, LLP, Business Consultants and CPAs for the year ending June 30, 2014 were as follows:\n\t \nJune 30, 2012:  There were findings addressing matters that are opportunities for strengthening internal controls and operating efficiency. The fiscal impact would be returning to the Federal Government 50% of $500,000, which would $250,000.\n\t \nJune 30, 2013:   There was a material weakness over major federal award programs in regards to the Title III Endowment Challenge Grant. The fiscal impact would be returning to the Federal Government 50% of $500,000, which would $250,000.\n\t \nJune 30, 2014:   The auditors noted that The NHU Foundation had not implemented the recommendations as noted per the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. The fiscal impact would be returning to the Federal Government 50% of $500,000, which would $250,000.\n\t \n VI.        The Foundation for Hispanic Education:  Latino College Preparatory Academy\n\t \nThe Foundation for Hispanic Education:  Latino College Preparatory Academy has submitted a letter of good faith to work with the Administration on correcting any deficiencies and on developing a memorandum of understanding. \n\t \nCondition #1: Petition Deficiencies \n\t \nCorrect the deficiencies in the charter petition noted in the East Side Union High School District Charter School Review Matrix evaluation, submitted to the Board during these authorization proceedings and submit the final hard copy and electronic copy, inclusive of any supplemental charter petition documents by no later than January 22, 2016.

Brief Introduction and Summary or Recommendation\nOn October 5, 2015, Kristen McCaw, Director of Growth & Policy, Summit Public Schools, submitted a petition (“Petition”) dated October 5, 2015, signed by Dianne Tavenner, CEO, seeking renewal of the charter. Summit Public School: Rainer is a 9-12 school with a current enrollment of 358 students. The East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) approved the Summit Public School: Rainier (SPS: Rainier) charter on September 16, 2010, and granted SPS: Rainier a five-year term, July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016. \n\t \nOn October 29, 2015, Staff visited Summit Public School: Rainier to observe classrooms and met with parents, teachers, students and administrators. Staff held a teleconference with representatives from the Summit Public Schools board on November 18, 2015. During the site visit staff from the areas of Human Resources, Attendance Accounting and Facilities met with their respective counterparts at SPS: Rainier and found these areas to be satisfactory. Overall, the visited provided evidence that SPS: Rainier is implementing the educational program for which it was approved. \n\t \nStaff reviewed the Petition for Summit Public School: Rainier utilizing the criteria for charter approval set forth in Education Code Section 47605. Charter renewal is “governed by the standard and criteria set forth in Education Code Section 47605.” Through this report, Staff provides the Board with an assessment of the sufficiency of the Petition with respect to the criteria for approval.  Staff recommends that the Board review Staff’s analysis with respect to these criteria and make a finding regarding whether each criterion for approval has been satisfied.\n\t \nProcedural Requirements\nThe East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) received the SPS: Rainier Petition on October 15, 2015, during a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board held a public hearing on the Petition on November 19, 2015, to consider the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents. The Board will make a decision about whether to renew the charter on December 10, 2015. Education Code Section 47607 (a) (1) stipulates that “each renewal shall be for a period of five years.”\n\t \nCalifornia Education Code Section 47605 (b) requires that “following the review of the petition and the public hearing, the governing board of the school district shall either grant or deny the charter within 60 days of receipt of the petition, provided, however, that the date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension.” \n\t \nCriteria for Approval of Charter Renewal Petitions\nEducation Code Section 47605 establishes the requirements a petitioner must satisfy in order for his or her petition for renewal of the charter school to be approved. \n\t \nEducation Code Section 47605 (b) provides that the governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\nThe charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\nThe petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\nThe petition does not contain the number of parent or teacher signatures required by Education Code Section 47605 (A)-(B).  \nThe petition does not contain an affirmation that the charter school “shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations, shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis” pursuant to [Education Code] Section 220 of “disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance….”\nThe petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following:\nA description of the educational program of the school, designed, among other things, to identify those whom the school is attempting to educate, what it means to be an “educated person” in the 21st century, and how learning best occurs. The goals identified in that program shall include the objective of enabling pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.\nThe measurable pupil outcomes identified for use by the charter school. \nThe method by which pupil progress in meeting those pupil outcomes is to be measured.\nThe governance structure of the school, including, but not limited to the process to be followed by the school to ensure parental involvement.\nThe qualifications to be met by individuals to be employed by the school.\nThe procedures that the school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupils and staff. \nThe means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted.\nAdmission requirements, if applicable.\nThe manner in which annual, independent, financial audits shall be conducted, in accordance with regulations established by the State Board of Education, and the manner in which audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be resolved.\nThe procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled.\nThe manner by which staff members of the charter schools will be covered by the State Teachers' Retirement System, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or federal social security.\nThe public school attendance alternatives for pupils residing within the school district who choose not to attend charter schools.\nA description of the rights of any employee of the school district upon leaving the employment of the school district, to work in a charter school, and of any rights of return to the school district after employment at a charter school.\nThe procedures to be followed by the charter school and the entity granting the charter to resolve disputes relating to the provisions of the charter.\nA declaration whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public school employer of the employees of the charter school for the purposes of the Educational Employment Relations Act.\nA description of the procedures to be used if the charter school closes. The procedures shall ensure a final audit of the school to determine the disposition of all assets and liabilities of the charter school, including plans for disposing of any net assets and for the maintenance and transfer of pupil records.\n\t \nReview of the Petition\n\t \nStaff reviewed the Petition for Summit Public School: Rainier utilizing the criteria for charter approval and renewal set forth in East Side Union High School District Board Policy 0420.4 and California Education Code Section 47605. Staff’s assessment of the information provided in the Petition with respect to each of the criterion in Education Code Section 47605 is set forth below and on the attached East Side Union High School Staff Charter School Review Matrix \n(Appendix A).\n\t \nRequired Elements and Findings in Accordance with Education Code Section 47605(b)\nEducational Program\n\t \nStaff finds that the Petition contains a sufficient description of the educational program.\nAbility to Successfully Implement the Program Set Forth in the Petition\nStaff finds no facts that demonstrate the petitioner is unlikely to successfully implement the program.\nRequired Parent or Teacher Signatures \nStaff finds that the request for renewal does not require new signatures be gathered. The original signatures presented for Summit Public School: Rainier are valid.\nRequired Affirmations \nStaff finds that the Petition contains all of the required affirmations.\nComprehensive Descriptions  \nStaff finds that the Petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements, except the following:\nMeasurable Student Outcomes listed in the section above at B:\nStaff found that the Petition did not include in the course offerings the state minimum graduation requirement course for Economics.\n Governance Structure of the School (Including Parental involvement), listed in the section above at D:\nStaff finds that the Petition contains statements of the school’s expectation and the parent’s responsibility to “make their best effort to contribute at least 30 Community Hours per family each year” rather than the school’s recommendation or suggestion to that effect.\nEmployee Qualifications listed in the section above at E:\nStaff finds that the Petition does not describe the non-college prep teaching positions, staffed by non-certificated teachers and the qualifications for these teaching positions that will be determined by the Executive Director. \n  Admissions Requirements listed in the section above at H:\nStaff finds that the Petition contains insufficient information regarding the admissions and enrollment timeline.\n\t \nStaff finds that the Summit Public Schools Application for Enrollment requires students to provide information in the application used for the lottery that requires the students to reveal personal information that should be provided after the student has been admitted to the school. \n\t \nStaff found that the Application for Enrollment does not contain required information to parents and guardians regarding health care coverage and enrollment assistance specified in AB 2706. \nPupil Suspension and Expulsion listed in the section above at J:\nStaff finds that the Petition contains insufficient information regarding how the “residence school district”….”will be involved in disciplinary matters as specified in Education Code Section 47605 (d) (3).\n\t \nStaff finds that the Petition excluded sexual assault under “Non-Discretionary Suspension Offenses” and “Non-Discretionary Expellable Offenses.”\n\t \nFinancial Plan\nStaff determined that the financial plan was sufficient.\nAny Other Criteria Set Forth in Statute\nRacial and Ethnic Balance\nThe Education Code for charter approval addresses racial balance in two separate criteria.\nEducation Code Section 47605 (d) (1) states: “In addition to any other requirement imposed under this part, a charter school shall be nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations , shall not charge tuition, and shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Section 220“ (e.g., ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability).                                                                   \nEducation Code Section 47605 (b) (5) (G) requires that the charter petition contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the “means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the school district to which the charter petition is submitted.”\nPreference for Serving Academically Low Achieving Students\nCalifornia Education Code 47605 (h) states: “In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools within the school district, the governing board of the school district shall give preference to petitions that demonstrate the capability to provide comprehensive learning experiences to pupils identified by the petitioner or petitioners as academically low achieving pursuant to the standards established by the State Department of Education under Section 54032.” The renewal petition does not target or focus on recruiting or serving “academically low achieving students” and consequently should not be given preference for approval.\n\t \nV.     Charter School Performance Data\n\t \nAcademic Performance\nEducation Code Section 47605 (c) (1) requires that charter schools “meet all statewide standards” and participate in the statewide assessment system. Education Code Section 47607 (3) (A) makes clear that the most important factor that the Board must consider in making a charter renewal decision is “increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school.” \n\t \nSummit Rainier is currently in their 5th year of operation and has only had one graduating class, the class of 2015, therefore; public student achievement data is limited. Federal and state accountability is changing with the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Both of these things need to be considered when viewing the Evaluation Framework. Summit Rainier made Program Improvement (PI) targets until 2014-15 when all schools in the State missed the PI targets. The California High School Exit Exam is not aligned with the CCSS and as schools shift to the implementation of the CCSS it is expected that assessment results for assessment not aligned with CCSS will drop. Summit Rainier’s CAHSEE results were above the district prior to 2014-15 and dropped below the district average only after the transition to CCSS. Taking these constraints into consideration Summit Rainier has shown student achievement comparable to ESUHSD. \n\t \nEligibility for Renewal Findings\nSummit Public School: Rainier is in its fifth year of operation. Education Code Section 47607 (b) establishes a minimum standard that a charter school that has been in operation for four years must meet prerequisite to renewal. The charter school shall meet at least one of the following criteria prior to receiving a charter renewal:\nAttained its Academic Performance Index (API) growth target in the prior year or in two of the last three years, or in the aggregate for the prior three years.\nRanked in deciles 4 to 10, inclusive, on the API in the prior year or in two of the last three years.\nRanked in deciles 4 to 10, inclusive, on the API for a demographically comparable school in the prior year or in two of the last three years.\nThe entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend, as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school.”\n\t \nAs per Education Code § 47607 (B) (i), this determination is to be based on “clear and convincing data.” Based on the shift to Common Core State Standards and the revamping of the state accountability system, four of the above-listed data points are no longer available. East Side Union High School District has determined that Option #4 is the only criteria that can be calculated at this time.\n\t \nData on graduation, California High School Exit Exam, and Smarter Balanced Grade 11 assessment results (See Appendix B) were used to compare the student achievement of students attending Summit Rainier with the student achievement of students at the three comparison schools: Independence High School, James Lick High School, and Mt. Pleasant High School. The data show that in some instances students at the comparison schools outscore students at Summit Rainier, and in some instances, Summit Rainier students outscore students at the comparison schools. But in general, students attending Summit Rainier show academic achievement comparable to students attending the comparison schools.  Thus, Summit Rainier qualifies to submit a charter renewal petition per Education Code 47607(b).\n\t \nEast Side Union High School District Monitoring\nAn East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) team which includes representatives from Educational Services, Business Services, Special Services, Human Resources, and Facilities conducts a compliance oversight review of the charter schools each year. The monitoring includes site visits, document reviews, interviews with school administrators (and stakeholders on occasion), and a review of the school’s website. A follow-up review is conducted in the spring to ensure that the issues identified as non-compliant are satisfactorily resolved. The annual monitoring reviews have found Summit Public School: Rainier to be compliant in the implementation of the educational program.  Areas of noncompliance have focused on areas of governance and the availability of board agenda, clarifying information requested on the admissions application, and staffing classrooms with qualified teachers with the required authorizations. The school has been responded by satisfactorily addressing noted areas of noncompliance. \n\t \nFinancial Performance\nThe Summit Public School: Rainier annual independent audits conducted by Vicenti, Lloyd and Stutzman, LLP, Business Consultants and Certified Public Accountants, for the years ending June 30, 2013 and June 2014 were clean with no “findings and questioned costs related to the basic financial statements, state awards, or federal awards.” \n\t \n    VI.        Summit Public School:  Rainier Good Faith Letter\n\t \nSummit Public School:  Rainier has submitted a letter of good faith to work with the Administration on correcting any deficiencies and on developing a memorandum of understanding.  \n\t \nCondition #1: Petition Deficiencies \n\t \nCorrect the deficiencies in the charter petition noted in the East Side Union High School District charter School Review Matrix evaluation, submitted to the Board during these authorization proceedings, and submit a final hard copy and electronic copy, inclusive of any supplemental charter petition documents by no later than January 22, 2016. The deficiencies are delineated above in Section IV.\n\t \nCondition #2:  Memorandum of Understanding \n\t \nSummit Public Schools must successfully negotiated an acceptable Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with the District no later than March 3, 2016. \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:  \nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposed Summit Public School: Rainier charter renewal petition submitted by Kristen McCaw, Director of Growth & Policy, Summit Public Schools on behalf of Diane Tavenner, CEO, Summit Public Schools.

Two DBEs elected to participate in the design and cost competition:  \nFlint Builders + JK Architecture Partnership + MFDB Architects (“Flint”)\nOveraa Construction with Gould Evans (“Overaa”)\n\t \nOn October 13, 2015, the District received proposals from these DBEs.\n\t \n\t \nProposal Evaluation Summary\nThe assessment of District staff and construction management staff from Kitchell is that while both proposals are responsive to the RFP, Flint’s proposal provides the best value to the District.  The following summarizes the District’s assessment of the nine selection criteria, which were described in the RFP. \n\t \nPrice:  Each Design-Build Entity could earn a maximum of fifteen (15) points in this category. A maximum of thirteen (13) points could be earned for offering the best value within the District’s stipulated budget of $16.1 million.  Another maximum of two (2) points could be earned from the value offered in the unsolicited alternates included in the proposal.\n\t \nFlint’s proposal offers 36,000 square feet of new and modernized space to accommodate the program, all into an integrated single building that will feel 100% new and allow for improved student learning facilities, access and student traffic flow.  Overaa’s proposal offers 33,000 square feet of new and modernized space to accommodate the program; however, the modernized space would be existing Buildings 800 and 1000, which would be physically disconnected from the Student Union building.  Flint’s “up-cycling transformation” of existing space is superior to Overaa’s “modernization” of existing space.  Overaa received an additional point for offering interesting unsolicited alternates that would enhance the overall value of their proposal.  Flint and Overaa both received 9 points in this Price category.\n\t \nTechnical Expertise: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of eight (8) points in this category. \n\t \nBoth teams propose experienced teams of project managers, field superintendents, architects, subcontractors and specialty consultants to design and construct this project, earning them each 5 points in this category.\n\t \nLife Cycle Costs: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of eleven (11) points in this category, by proposing facilities whose sustainable design results in a low life cycle cost as calculated over a twenty-five (25) year period.  The life cycle cost calculation includes the first cost of the project, operating costs, and replacement costs of any systems/components whose service lives do not exceed twenty-five (25) years. \n\t \nFlint’s proposal provides projected energy consumption and mechanical system maintenance, repair and replacement costs; however, it does not include information pertaining to water consumption, and non-mechanical building systems maintenance/repair/replacement costs.  Flint’s proposal earned 6 points in this category.  Overaa’s proposal provides projected energy and water consumption data that is incomplete; Overaa’s proposal does not include information about maintenance and repair costs, but does provide replacement costs for systems and building finish materials whose service lives are less than 25 years.  Overaa’s proposal earned 5 points in this category.\n\t \nSkilled Labor Force: Each DBE could earn a maximum of eight (8) points by satisfying the requirements for “skilled labor force availability” as defined in California Education Code Section 17250.10 – 17250.50.  Each was asked to evidence in its Proposal a commitment to furthering these goals:  1) maximizing opportunities for local, small and emerging businesses to compete fairly for work associated with this Project; 2) maximizing opportunities for local workers to be employed on the Project; and 3) incorporating requirements of the District’s Project Labor Agreement.\n\t \nFlint’s proposal demonstrates a commitment to the District’s Project Labor Agreement.  Overaa’s proposal does not include the Project Labor Agreement’s requirement for student internships, but it does demonstrate a commitment to a local workforce through the listed local subcontractors.  Both proposals earned 5 points in this category.\n\t \nAcceptable Safety Record: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of eight (8) points in this category.  Two (2) points could be earned by demonstrating an acceptable safety record.  An additional six (6) points could be earned by submitting a superior Project Safety Plan (PSP), evidencing an exceptionally comprehensive Injury & Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), and having a low Experience Modification Factor rating. \n\t \nThe primary metric of an acceptable safety record is a contractor’s Experience Modification Rate (EMR), which is a measure of the frequency of accidents and injuries that a contractor has incurred on a historical basis.  At 0.83, Flint’s EMR is better than the industry average of 1.0; they provide evidence of an IIPP as well as an acceptable PSP; they earned 4 points in this category.  Overaa’s EMR of 0.69 is significantly better than industry average and superior to Flint’s, they provide a superior IIPP and PSP; Overaa earned 5 points in this category.\n\t \nSchedule: Each DBE could earn a maximum of eight (8) points by proposing creative scheduling that will reduce the overall length of time of construction, as well as minimize the impact on the site as a whole. \n\t \nBoth DBEs propose aggressive project schedules.  Overaa’s proposed schedule offers an earlier completion date along with an unsolicited alternate for an accelerated completion in Summer 2017, earning 5 points in this category.  Flint earned 4 points in this category.  Flint’s proposed scheduled offers more realistic timelines, finishing 3 months later than Overaa’s proposed schedule.\n\t \nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation: Each DBE could earn a maximum of seventeen (17) points in this category, through the quality of their design solutions as well as the level of innovation reflected in each DBE’s design solution, and its overall approach to constructing the Project. \n\t \nFlint’s design solution proposes to retain and up-cycle Buildings 800, 1000 and a portion of Building 100, and provide new steel construction for the larger open program spaces of the union, learning center and associated support spaces.  The up-cycled existing structures and new large volume space would celebrate the Flint team’s approach to balancing the transformation of existing resources and new construction.   The balanced approach grounds the proposed building in the strong existing architectural vernacular of the existing campus while concurrently introducing an exciting modern vernacular to the campus entry and quad.  The proposed solution offers 10% better energy efficiency than required by Title 24 (California’s Building Code).  This enhanced energy efficiency, reuse through up-cycling of existing structures into the new Student Union building, along with other design innovations allows Flint to offer a LEED Silver certification (within the project budget).  LEED is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, administered by the United States Green Building Council who offers basic, Silver, Gold and Platinum certifications to projects that meet sustainability criteria.  \n\t \nFlint’s proposed exterior improvements include a strong entrance experience from the parking lot into the quad and into the Student Union.  Patios adjacent to the building edges provide a seamless transition from the indoor environment outward.  The outside environment takes additional queues from the building’s architectural form and program to provide clear wayfinding and flexible outdoor gathering, eating and learning spaces.  The design offers strategic handling of the existing 24” grade differential between the new Student Union and the existing shade structure in the quad.  The north steps of the existing shade structure will be removed and the quad area reconstructed with a plaza that is much flatter and effectively drains away from the building. There will be numerous transitions around the existing shade structure and clock tower as well as to the surrounding pathways and plazas. The end goal is to create a seamless flow to and from the Student Union to all points of the campus, resolving existing accessibility deficiencies in the process.\n\t \nFlint’s proposal earned 13 points in this category.\n\t \nOveraa’s design solution proposes to retain and modernize Buildings 800 and 1000 as classroom and support spaces.  The separate new Student Union building would introduce an exciting modern architectural vernacular to the campus.  The new building would have a strong entrance connection to the parking lot, and also connect to the quad. The proposed mechanical system is sophisticated and energy efficient.  Overaa’s proposal offers LEED certification as an unsolicited alternate at an undisclosed additional price.  Overaa’s proposal provides a complete future vision for the quad with a reinvented landscape approach to Native California Landscape Communities.  However, this new quad is not included in Overaa’s proposal; the extent of proposed exterior improvements is 20 feet around the buildings, with a note that the remainder of quad improvements is beyond the project budget. Overaa’s proposal earned 11 points in this category.\n\t \n\t \nProject Management Plan: Each DBE could earn a maximum of eight (8) points by evidencing superiority in their proposed logistics plan, quality assurance/quality control plan, structure of organizational chart, knowledge/skill/ability/experience of key personnel, Owner/DBE interaction strategies, and other aspects of project management. \n\t \nOveraa’s proposal includes information that conveys their plan adequately, which earned them 4 points in this category.  Flint’s proposal includes the required information, plus additional information that offers a superior understanding of how they plan to interact with stakeholders and their design philosophy for each design discipline, which earned them 5 points in this category.\n\t \nProgram Requirements: Each DBE could earn a maximum of seventeen (17) points by proposing a design that achieves the project’s program requirements as specified in the RFP. \n\t \nFlint’s proposal best meets the Project’s program requirements by offering more square footage to elegantly and functionally house the required program spaces, complying with District facility design standards, and meeting contractual requirements.  Flint earned 12 points in this category.  Overaa’s proposal offers less square footage, which meets space program requirements but in a manner that would not be as elegant and functional as Flint’s design; Overaa’s proposal did not entirely meet compliance with design standard and contractual requirements.  Overaa earned 11 points in this category.  \n\t \nBased on the proposal evaluation described above, the final score for each DBE is as follows:\n\t \nSelection Criteria\nMaximum Possible\nPoints\nFlint\nOveraa\nPrice\n15\n9\n9\nTechnical Expertise\n8\n5\n5\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years\n11\n6\n5\nSkilled Labor Force Availability\n8\n5\n5\nAcceptable Safety Record\n8\n4\n5\nSchedule\n8\n4\n5\nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation\n17\n13\n11\nProject Management Plan\n8\n5\n4\nProgram Requirements\n17\n12\n11\nTotal\n100\n63\n60\n\t \n\t \nBest and Final Proposal Negotiations\nThe RFP specified that following the scoring of each DBE’s proposal, at which time the DBE whose proposal is deemed most responsive to the RFP was determined, and pursuant to Education Code §17250.25(a)(2)(v), the District reserved the right to hold discussions or negotiations with that DBE for the purpose of receiving clarification and/or modification to their proposal, in order to achieve a resulting Best and Final Proposal that could be recommended to the Board of Trustees for contract award.\n\t \nWhile Flint’s original proposed design offered an elegant solution to the program requirements and opportunities presented by the siting of the building, the District worked with Flint to optimize their proposed design.  The result is a design that enhances the connection to the Learning Center and allows for better student flow throughout the building.  The District’s RFP noted the opportunity for DBEs to provide alternate pricing for replacement of the campus main switchgear; replacement of the switchgear is a Measure G funded project, and coordination of switchgear sizing and campus power shutdown with the design and construction of this flagship Student Union project is in the District’s best interest.  The District’s project team also worked with Flint to determine which proposed solicited and unsolicited alternates would be included in the best and final proposal.  Flint’s Best and Final Proposal to design and construct the Student Union and Quad Modernization Project, including replacement of the campus main electrical switchgear, is $17,609,268.\n\t \n\t \nStipend\nA stipend is an amount paid by the owner to those responsive proposers who are unsuccessful in obtaining contract award. A stipend enhances competition to generate market interest in the project from the most highly qualified DBEs, helps defray costly proposal development incurred by DBEs, signals the intent that the owner is serious about carrying the project forward, and encourages proposers to expend the time, money and resources to provide a more creative and comprehensive solution.  The Design-Build Institute of America is an industry organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design-build; this organization recommends the payment of stipends as a best practice.  In the Federal sector, OMB Circular No. A-11 (2006) encourages the use of stipends for reasons described above.\n\t \nThe RFP stipulated that if the District awards a Contract for the Project, the District will pay a Stipend in the amount of $7,500 to each non-successful Design-Build Entity that submits a Proposal which is deemed by the District to be responsive and responsible. Overaa submitted a responsive and responsible Proposal, and should be awarded the $7,500 Stipend if the District awards a Contract to Flint.\n\t \n                                                                                                                               \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n\t \nAmount\nFunding Source\nNotes\n$          500,000\nMeasure G (Site Improvements / Deferred Maintenance)\nBoard approved September 15, 2011, Board Item 13.01\n         4,682,268\nMeasure E Yerba Buena Allocation\nBoard approved, June 18, 2009,\nBoard Item 15.01\n         6,105,000\nMeasure I Restoration of Yerba Buena Measure E Allocation\nBoard approved June 11, 2013, \nBoard Item 15.02\n         2,265,000\nMeasure I Yerba Buena Allocation\nBoard approved February 13, 2014,\nBoard Item 15.03\n              64,500\nFund 35 Allocation to Yerba Buena Student Union Project\nBoard approved February 13, 2014,\nBoard Item 15.03\n        4,000,000\nMeasure E Board/Cabinet Discretionary Funds Allocated to Yerba Buena Student Union Project\nBoard approved September 17, 2015, Board Item 15.01\n $  17,616,768\nTOTAL\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nBased on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees:\nAdopt the above Proposal Evaluation Summary as its findings;\nFind that, on the basis of such information, the design-build Project and the Flint proposal as described above will reduce comparable project costs, help expedite the Project’s completion, and/or provide features not available through the traditional design-bid-build method;\nAward a design-build contract for the Yerba Buena High School Student Union and Quad Modernization Project, and Replacement of the Campus Main Electrical Switchgear, to Flint Builders, in the amount of $17,609,268; and\nApprove payment of the $7,500 stipend to Overaa Construction, Inc., for Overaa’s responsive participation in the design and cost competition.\n",
