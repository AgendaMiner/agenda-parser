The FMP was used to inform the capital construction projects executed using Measure G general obligation bond funds.  Although the FMP has not been updated, it has been used – along with the project lists generated by School Site Councils out of the FMP – to inform the planning and project selection processes associated with Measures E and I.\n\t \nProposition 39 type bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities must include accountability measures, including a list of the specific school facilities projects to be funded certification that the school district board has evaluated safety, class size reduction, and information technology needs in developing that list.\n\t \nDistrict staff recommends engaging a firm to update the 2004 Facilities Master Plan.  An updated plan will provide an appropriate framework for pursuit of additional funds to continue the school facilities modernization program, and to execute that program efficiently, effectively and in compliance with Proposition 39 general obligation bond accountability measures.  The planning process will include engagement and collaboration with constituent groups as called for in Board Policy 7110 Facilities Master Plan.\n\t \nThe proposed preliminary timeline for an updated facilities master plan is as follows:\nMaster plan RFQ/P:  January 2016\nContract award:  March 2016\nMaster planning:  March – June 2016\nBoard approval:  August 2016\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable                                                    \n                                                                                               \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nFund 35 School Facilities Fund\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize administration to solicit proposals for an updated facilities master plan, bring forth a recommendation for a facilities master planning contract award at the March Board meeting, and proceed with the updated facilities master planning initiative per the delineated timeline.\n",

Construction Project List for Piedmont Hills High School\n\t \nOn February 13, 2014, the Board of Trustees approved the 2013 Capital Construction Project Lists for Piedmont Hills High School (Item 15.03).  The Project List included three funded projects:  a new classroom building east of Building L, modernization of Building G, and modernization of Building K into science classrooms.  \n\t \nSince that time, prior approved projects have been completed and closed out, and projects on the 2013 Project Lists were initiated, including award of contracts for construction management and design services.  Design for these three projects has advanced to the 75% schematic design milestone.  In addition to review of as-built record documents for existing structures and numerous site visits, the design and construction management teams have met with school representatives on eight occasions to validate program requirements, receive feedback on classroom layout options, and verify that the projects are within the established budgets.  The resulting schematic designs for the new building and for modernized Building G are satisfactory.  However, due to existing structural shear walls in Building K, the modernization of that building into science classrooms would result in undersized labs whose configurations would not satisfy program requirements.  \n\t \nThe design and construction management teams explored various options that would improve the outcome for the science program.  A new building south of Building D, to include four science classrooms, four general education classrooms, one special education classroom plus support facilities was identified as the most viable option to satisfy science program needs, as well as provide some of the general and special education space that would have been part of the new building east of Building L.  The required funding for this option would necessitate deferment of the Buildings G and K modernizations, as well as the new classroom building east of Building L.\n\t \nSchool Site Council recommends development of the new building south of Building D in lieu of modernizing Building K to house science classrooms.  School Site Council further recommends deferring the modernization of Building G and construction of a new building east of Building L, and redirecting that associated funding to the new building south of Building D.  \n\t \nSuperintendent’s Council has reviewed this recommendation, and is in support of the project list revision.\n\t \nApproved Project\nProposed Project\nCurrent

List for Santa Teresa High School\n\t \nOn February 13, 2014, the Board of Trustees approved the 2013 Capital Construction Project Lists for Santa Teresa High School (Item 15.03).  The Project List included nine funded projects.  On May 14, 2015, the Board approved de-funding of the Gymnasium Building 700 Foyer Modernization and Tennis Courts Expansion projects so that Santa Teresa could redirect funding to a larger swimming pool (Item 15.01).\n\t \nSince that time, prior approved projects have been completed and closed out, and projects on the 2013 Project Lists were initiated, including award of contracts for construction management, design services and a pre-engineered science classroom/restroom building for Phoenix High School.  While design work on most of these projects is well underway, the Upgrade Building 100, Room 101 Life Skills Studio project is no longer a project that Santa Teresa High School is interested in pursuing.  In the time that the project list was developed by site constituents and administration, and reviewed by District administration, Calero High School was just opening.  Calero has become a successful post senior program space, and is a local resource to Santa Teresa’s community.  Calero’s geographical adjacency allows Santa Teresa to focus its resources on standard academic curriculum, and for Calero to offer life skills curriculum in a post senior environment.\n\t \nAt the same time, Santa Teresa is realizing an increased demand for science classroom facilities.  The current science department collaboration space is in Building 400, Room 410 – a location with existing utilities and adjacency to science prep rooms – making it ideal for conversion to an additional science classroom.  The department collaboration space can be relocated to Building P1.\n\t \nConcurrently, design work is advancing for the new Science Classroom and Restrooms for Phoenix High School, along with development of a new Student Courtyard to provide an appropriate outdoor environment.  The new building and courtyard will result in the loss of approximately three dozen parking spaces in that area of the campus.  The adjacent underutilized basketball courts can be repurposed to replace the lost parking.\n\t \nSchool Site Council recommends revising the Life Skills Studio project budget to cover the very small amount of expenditures that have been realized to date, and cancelling the project.  School Site Council further recommends converting Room 410 into an additional science classroom, and converting the basketball courts on the south side of campus to mitigate parking loss due to the Phoenix mini-campus development.\n\t \nSuperintendent’s Council has reviewed this recommendation, and is in support of the project list revision.\n\t \nApproved Project\nProposed Project\nCurrent Budget\nProposed Budget\nNotes\nNew Stadium Ancillary Building (Concessions Building 2300)\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$882,519\n$882,519\nNo
