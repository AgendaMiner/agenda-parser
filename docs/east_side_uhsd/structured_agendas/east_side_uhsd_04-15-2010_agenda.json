The four partners in the consortium are Metropolitan Adult Education, Campbell Union High School District, Mountain View-Los Altos Adult Education, Santa Clara Adult Education, and Sunnyvale-Cupertino Adult Education.  With the assistance of our consortium members, the East Side Adult Education has served as the lead partner in this consortium and is charged with submitting the application, monitoring the progress toward goal achievement, and evaluating the Carl Perkins plan annually.Accomplishments:Utilizing information for Central Santa Clara County from the Employment Development Department, input from the five Adult Education Program Advisory Committees, and staff and student surveys, the CTE Consortium Advisory Committee identified two industry sectors and related career pathways addressed in this five year plan.  Perkins funds will be used to assist programs in Health and Science which will focus on Clinical Nursing, Medical Assistant, and Home Health Aide Assistant career pathways.  The second industry sector is Information Technology, which will focus on Administrative Assistant, Database Administrator, Support & Services Technician, Desktop Publishing, and Accounting career pathways.  The Adult Education Programs in the consortium offer a thriving program for the completion of a secondary education and English language development and providing career learning opportunities in health, medicine, and information technology that have numerous entry and advancements options will complement our programs.

The original contracts were based on a set of assumptions regarding the production schedule to manufacturing the T-Structures and the written requirements from DSA.

The project has been determined to be an immediate need, due to safety and equity concerns.  Also clarified during the budget presentation is the understanding that the funding of this effort is available from the uncommitted campus allocation, and has been approved as a priority by the Principal, Glenn VanderZee.One overriding consideration is to maintain the reliable level of design and construction results that have been realized across the District, including James Lick High School.  Verde Design, Inc. has been retained for the majority of recent field and outdoor athletic facility work with the District.Selection Process Verde Design, Inc. has proven to be a qualified consultant and designer, specializing in field design work, and is the only A/E firm in the qualified pool specializing in athletic fields.  ESUHSD has employed their services for several other field, scoreboard, and dugout projects.  The project schedules and budgets have been adhered to, with satisfactory results.  This project was developed quickly out of a recent Title IX compliance and safety concern, thus necessitating the selection of a known, qualified consultant.RECOMMENDATION:This item is contingent on the approval of revised Measure E budget, presented as item 14.03.  It is recommended that the Board of Trustees enter into a Work Authorization Agreement with Verde Design, Inc. for the term of April 16, 2010, through June 30, 2012, for the provision of architectural design services for the James Lick High School Title IX Field Improvement Project. 3.

With this list in place, the District then requests from all four of the pre-approved firms to submit a “Construction Management Selection Questionnaire (CMSQ)” which will include the cost and project team being proposed.  In this case, back on June 9, 2009, Facilities requested CMSQ from three of the four firms.  At that time Facilities Management Planning and Operations, Inc. was selected to be recommended to the Board for approval.  However, at that time and at subsequent meetings this project was removed from the Board agenda.For this Board meeting, purchasing requested that new proposals be obtained due to the age of the old proposals and the fact that the hard cost had increased significantly which would affect the cost proposals previously submitted.

The first funds for Measure E were sold in May of 2008. The Board of Trustees approved a detailed Measure E Bond Program Master Budget in February, 2009. Modifications to project scope and attendant budgets have been brought to the Board for consideration and approval in the ensuing period - including June 2009, August 2009, and September 2009. A combination of economic conditions and these periodic adjustments have had an impact on the internal consistency of the overall Master Measure E Program Budget.Aggressive schedule management has also enabled concurrent launch of over 30 projects, allowing the District to take full advantage of the exceptional bidding climate and create as many new jobs as possible in the regional market. Additionally, the Facilities and Planning Division will continue to apply for State modernization funds to provide greater leverage to our existing Bond Program. A status review of current projects will accompany consideration of this item.The Facilities and Planning Division will review the Measure E Master Budget on an ongoing basis as a means of sustaining an aggressive approach to the delivery of projects under the Measure E Bond Program, allowing the District to leverage Bond dollars to the maximum extent, while exercising best fiscal practices.The Facilities Bond Team will be present to answer questions from the Board of Trustees.FISCAL IMPACT:   No fiscal impact change.
