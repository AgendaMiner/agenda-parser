With assistance from committee members, information was shared and stakeholders had opportunities to comment on suggested plans.  Andrew Hill held town hall meetings with staff and parents to gather input, and Independence shared their progress with staff at meetings and parents during School Site Council meetings.\nChoose one of the four following options as their restructuring/alternative governance structure.\n               a.  Close the school and reopen it as a charter school.\n               b.  Replace all or most of the school staff (which may include the principal) who are\n                    relevant to the failure to make AYP.\n               c.  Enter into a contract with an entity, such as a private management company with\n                    a demonstrated record of effectiveness, to operate the public school.\n               d.  Implement any other major restructuring of the school's governance arrangement\n                    that makes fundamental reforms and leads to improved student achievement.\n\t\t \n          After completing the CDE recommended protocol, Andrew Hill and Independence selected \n          D, that is, to implement an alternative governance structure.\n\t\t \n          Andrew Hill High School plan for alternative governance structure - The main focus areas   \n          of alternative governance structure are as follows:\n  \n                 *  Smaller Learning Communities\n                 *  Whole school participation by department of Professional Development focusing\n                     on engaging students\n                 *  Assessing student learning\n                 *  Extending learning to close the achievement gap\n\t\t \n\t\t \n           Independence High School plan for alternative governance structure - The three main\n           focus areas of their alternative governance structure are as follows:\n\t\t \n                 *  Develop and align instruction with content standards with focus on English language\n                     learners and special education.\n                 *  Implement common assessments and ongoing collaboration to inform staff about the\n                     effectiveness of instruction.\n                 *  Implement an intervention plan for students with multiple \"F\" grades.\n          \n      4.

The major focus of the DE course is to expose students to the design process of combinational and sequential logic design, teamwork, communication methods, engineering standards and technical documentation.\n\t\t \nElements of Human/Family Service\nThis course will assist the students in examining the components of career choice.  The focus in on career, personal and education awareness as they relate to the process of selecting a career and/or program of study at a university.  Students will identify personal interests, values, abilities and skills and will use self-assessment instruments to help them identify career options and goals.  Lifestyles and personal satisfaction will be discussed as related to the world of work.  Decision making strategies, resume writing, interviewing skills and job search techniques will be reviewed.  Students in the course will learn to assess their strengths and weaknesses and potential for personal growth.  Students will take the ADVAB career aptitude test.  In addition, students will examine the community service issues that are experienced by clients and providers of family service agencies, including drug/alcohol abuse, domestic violence, health issues, disabilities and mental illness.\n\t\t \nGenres of Composition\nThis is a two-semester English credit course that offers additional preparation in composition and response techniques, exploring a broad range of rhetorical modes (narrative, argumentation, informational expository, analytical expository, business communication, technical writing) with an emphasis on understanding nonfiction text.  Students perform multiple pieces of writing, composing a minimum of six original multiple-paragraph essays aligned with the California Content Standards for English/Language Arts Standards.  Class can not be repeated.\n\t\t \nIntroduction to Energy Management and Environmental Careers\nThis course gives an overview of the field of Energy Management and its importance in today's society, including future implications, and discussion of careers and impact on modern culture and society.  This module introduces the whole building concept and related energy and conservation issues including the building envelope, HVAC systems, lighting, energy management and controls renewable energy technologies.\n\t\t \nIntroduction to Engineering Design\nIn this course, students use 3D solid modeling design software to help them design solutions to solve proposed problems.  Students will learn how to document their work and communicate solutions to peers and members of the professional community.  The major focus of the IED course is to expose students to the design process, research and analysis, teamwork, communication methods, global and human impacts, engineering standards and technical documentation.\n\t\t \nManufacturing I\nThe Manufacturing I course will teach students the foundational manufacturing processes which are essential to the manufacturing industry.  In this hands-on course, students will learn the safe operation of the drill press, metal lathe, milling machine, sheet metal equipment and arc welding.  Students also learn to thread using taps and dies, and strengthen their basic measuring and precision measuring skills.  Students will make a variety of projects using all of the machines mentioned above as well as various sanders and grinders.\n\t\t \nManufacturing II\nThe Manufacturing II course will introduce students to AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CNC programing and operating various CNC machinery.  AutoCAD is a two dimensional design software package while SolidWorks is a 3-dimensional solid modeling design package.  The students will study AutoCAD and SolidWorks for the first semester, then study CNC programming and the operation of CNC machinery the second semester.  CNC programming involves using the Cartesian Coordinate System to describe geometry.  The computer code is written so that the CNC machine will operate automatically to cut geometry described by the program.  The programming is written in two formats: conversational and G & M codes.  Students will operate CNC machinery in order to complete various hands-on projects.\n\t\t \nPrinciples of Engineering\nThis survey course of engineering exposes students to some of the major concepts they will encounter in a postsecondary engineering course of study.  Students have an opportunity to investigate engineering and high-tech careers and to develop skills and understanding of course concepts.  Students employ engineering and scientific concepts in the solution of engineering design problems.  They develop problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge of research and design to create solutions to various challenges.  Students also learn how to document their work and communicate their solutions to peers and members of the professional community.\n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t \nFUNDING
