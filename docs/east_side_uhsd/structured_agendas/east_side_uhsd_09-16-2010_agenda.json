or\nThe petition does not contain reasonable comprehensive descriptions of the 15 elements of a charter school set forth in Education Code Section 47605(b)\n\t \nIf the Board makes one or more of these five findings, it must also adopt written factual findings that are specific to the issues raised in this particular Petition.\n\t \nThe District’s administration team carefully reviewed and analyzed the Petition, and met with representatives from Summit Public Schools in order to discuss their petition.  As set forth in the attached Proposed Findings, Administration recommends that the Summit Public Schools – Rainier Charter Petition be granted, subject to the following conditions being met: (1) the parties will enter into a mutually agreeable Memorandum of Understanding implementing, as necessary, the approved provisions of the Petition; (2) Article IV (“Governance Structure”) of the Petition shall be revised to reflect that the ESUHSD Governing Board shall be entitled to a representative on the Board of Directors of Summit Public Schools in accordance with Education Code section 47604(b); (3) The Petition will be amended to specify whether the members of the Board of Directors are compensated and, if so, identify the types and amount of compensation and indicate where in the budget (Petition, Exhibit “R”, Operating Budget) such compensation is reflected; (4) to ensure parent and community participation, the Petition and Appendix I thereto will be modified to clarify that all meetings of the Board of Directors of Summit Public Schools shall be held within the territorial jurisdiction of the East Side Union High School District; (5) ESUHSD does not agree to the “Dispute Resolution” provisions contained at pp. 55-57 of the Petition insofar as such terms are different than, in addition to, or a limitation on or alteration of the ESUHSD’s rights and oversight responsibilities under the Education Code; (6) the Petition shall be modified to reflect whether or not Summit Public Schools will impose a fee or charge on its students for after-school and extra-curricular activities and programs.\n\t \nIn addition, administration strongly recommends and encourages Summit Public Schools to modify the “Public Random Drawing and Preferences” on pp. 59-60 of the Petition to grant first and second priority preferences for admission to District residents including: (i) siblings of currently enrolled students or graduates of SPS: Rainier residing within the boundaries of the District, and (ii) students residing within the boundaries of the District.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE\nGeneral Fund\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT\nIf approved there will be fiscal impact.  The anticipated fiscal impact is not subject to quantification at this time due to the varying uncertainties with state funding, actual charter operations and the extent to which the charter school draws upon non-reimbursable District services.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n \nRECOMMENDATION\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees give careful consideration to this Petition and the concerns raised by the Administration.  If the Boards acts to deny the Petition, the Board should adopt the attached Findings as support for the Board’s decision. \n",

The intent of this program is to meet the ARRA goals of stimulating the economy and generating jobs.\n\t \nRegulations regarding the 2010 QSCB program have been passed by the State Legislature and await the Governor’s signature for enactment.  Applications may be submitted to the California Department of Education 30 business days after enactment.  As with the 2009 QSCB program, applications will be limited to $25 million per district.  However, unlike last year’s program, only those districts able to repay the QSCBs with available GO bond authority will be permitted to apply (with certain minor exceptions).  Selection among applicants will be made on the following basis: a) date of receipt of application (by certified mail);  b) projects having Department of State Architect approval and; c) the greater percentage of a district’s pupils who qualify for the federal free and reduced priced meals program and are enrolled in the program. \n\t \nShould the District receive a QSCB allocation, this program may allow for the acceleration of the District’s proposed projects.  While the prospect of low interest financing is attractive, the amount borrowed under the QSCB program must still be repaid within a 13 to 17-year timeframe.  As such, the District’s financial advisor, Dale Scott & Company, will work with staff to develop a financing program that serves the best interests of the District and its taxpayers.  \n\t \nThe apparent benefits of the QSCB program suggest it would be advantageous to submit an allocation application.  The attached resolution is designed to accompany the application to the State.  If, after applying and receiving an allocation, the District decides not to use all or a part of the allocation for whatever reason, it can be returned without penalty to the State.   Any subsequent financings that take place due to receipt of a QSCB allocation by the District will be brought to the Board for approval.  All professional fees and expenses associated with the QSCB application process and subsequent transactions are wholly contingent on the successful completion of the necessary financings and will not be paid out of the District’s general fund.  \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Appllicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2010/2011-10 Authorizing Filing Application for Qualified School Construction Bond Allocation and Approving Related Actions. \n",
