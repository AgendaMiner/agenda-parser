The refinancing of these bonds is possible due to recent reductions in interest rates. The number of years over which the new bonds will be repaid will not be increased nor will the structure of the new bonds include any capital appreciation bonds. All interest rate savings will be returned to taxpayers in the form of reduced property tax assessments. While the savings from the refinancing of the bonds are projected to be well above industry guidelines, should market rates rise and the refinancing become infeasible, the District will not be responsible for any costs associated with the attempted refinancing.  The bonds will be sold through a negotiated bid which has been the District’s predominant method of bringing bond refinancing to market. The underwriter of the refinancing will be selected based on proposals submitted to the District. An overview of this selection process as well as projected savings from the refinancing will be made by the District’s financial advisor.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nIf sold, the Bonds are payable from ad valorem property taxes levied on taxpayers in the District.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nAll associated cost of issuance will be paid from funds received through the issuance of the bond.\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2014/2015-27 authorizing the issuance and sale of 2015 General Obligation Refunding Bonds in the Principal amount of not to exceed $46,000,000, for the purpose of refunding outstanding General Obligation Bonds of the District.  \n",

Pleasant High School Booster Club Approval to Solicit Contributions or Funds per Education Code 51520 and 51521\n\t\t \n\t\t \nThe Mt. Pleasant High School Booster Club is a separately organized and controlled non-profit entity that in the past has raised funds for Mt. Pleasant High School student programs.  The booster organization is not controlled by or overseen by the District.  The law requires, however, that the booster organization must obtain the District’s approval to solicit funds on the school site for the benefit of students, or if it solicits funds on the representation that the money received is to be used in whole or in part for the benefit of Mt. Pleasant High School or any other District school or students.\n\t\t \nEducation Code section 51520(a) provides: \n\t\t \n“During school hours, and within one hour before the time of opening and within one hour after the time of closing of school, pupils of the public school shall not be solicited on school premises by teachers or others to subscribe or contribute to the funds of, to become members of, or to work for, any organization not directly under the control of the school authorities, unless the organization is a nonpartisan, charitable organization organized for charitable purposes by an act of Congress or under the laws of the State, the purpose of the solicitation is nonpartisan and charitable, and the solicitation has been approved by the county board of education or by the governing board of the school district in which the school is located.” (Emphasis added.)\n\t\t \nEducation Code section 51521 further provides in part: \n\t\t \n“No person shall solicit any other person to contribute to any fund or to purchase any item of personal property, upon the representation that the money received is to be used wholly or in part for the benefit of any public school or the student body of any public school, unless such person obtains the prior written approval of either the governing board of the school district in which such solicitation is to be made or the governing board of the school district having jurisdiction over the school or student body represented to be benefited by such solicitation, or the designee of either of such boards.”\n\t\t \nRecently, Administration became aware that the booster organization’s tax exempt status was revoked by the Internal Revenue Service for failure to file tax returns.  In addition, based on a review of the booster organization’s financial records, it appears that individuals were paid wages or a form of wages with booster funds although the booster has not issued IRS Form 1099-Miscellaneous to the individuals or otherwise report the taxable earnings paid to the IRS.  The District’s review of the booster’s accounting records and internal controls is on-going and other questionable practices have been identified and are under review.  On these bases, Administration recommends that the Board approve the suspension of the Mt. Pleasant High School Booster Club ‘s authorization to solicit contributions and funds on any District site for any purpose and/or upon the representation  that any money received is to be used wholly or in part for the benefit of any District students or academic or athletic programs.  Administration further recommends that no such solicitations shall occur or resume unless and until the Board reauthorize such activities, the booster organization has shown to the satisfaction of the District that the IRS has reinstated the booster organization’s tax exempt status, and that the booster organization has established and implemented appropriate controls and procedures to protect the District community.\n\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot Applicable  \n\t\t \nFunding Source:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the suspension of the Mt. Pleasant High School Booster Club authorization to solicit contributions or funds on any District site for any purpose and/or upon the representation that any money received is to be used wholly or in part for the benefit of any District students or academic or athletic programs.\n\t \n",
