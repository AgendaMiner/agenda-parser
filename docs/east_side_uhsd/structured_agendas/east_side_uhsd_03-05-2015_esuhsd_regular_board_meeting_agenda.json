Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance, and Facilities, André Bell, Assistant Director of Capital Accounting and Purchasing, Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager, Robert Ball, Bond Program Manager, SGI, and Greg Armendariz, Construction Manager, Swinerton Management & Consulting\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action to Approve the Update on Swimming Pool Modernization Project, and Request for Budget Augmentation\n\t \n\t \nThe districtwide Swimming Pool Modernization Project seeks to improve the swimming pool complexes at James Lick, Mt. Pleasant, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, William C. Overfelt, and Yerba Buena High Schools.  On December 11, 2012, the Board augmented the project budget in the amount of $10.5 million using Measure I funds (Item 16.03).  The Board of Trustees, pursuant to Education Code §17250.20, adopted Resolution 2012/2013-26 on March 21, 2013, to approve use of the design-build delivery method for the Swimming Pool Modernizations project affecting the remaining seven school sites (Item 15.03). \n\t \nThrough a prequalification process, the District selected two Design Build Entities (teams comprised of the firms that would provide comprehensive design and construction services).  A first round Request for Proposals was issued.  Proposals from each of the prequalified Design Build Entities were deemed nonresponsive.  The original construction management firm’s contract expired, and a new construction management firm was awarded a contract to complete the project. A second round Request for Proposals was issued; two responsive proposals were received and evaluated.\n\t \nEvaluation results indicate that some, but not all, the pools at the seven school sites can be modernized within the existing project budget.  This result was not unanticipated:  construction costs have been escalating due to workforce availability constraints associated with major public and private works in the region. In addition, the required scope of work has increased as new information about deteriorated and/or non code compliant existing conditions has become known through site investigations associated with design builder and construction management site visits during the proposal period.  \n\t \nWith various levels of budget augmentation, additional options are available as delineated on the attached presentation.  \nOption A shows what can be done within the existing budget of $12.5 million.  This option is not recommended, because it only provides a 30 year solution to four of the seven sites.\nOption B is not recommended.  Although it provides a 30 year solution to all seven sites, fulfills aquatic program requirements for swim classes, competition swim, water polo and diving, it also has the highest initial and life cycle costs.\nOptions C and D are the most favorable options, fulfilling aquatic program requirements and having lower life cycle costs.  Option C satisfies 3 of 4 aquatic program options, but does not allow for diving.  Option D fulfills all the aquatic program requirements, at a slightly higher initial cost associated with provision of a deep corner for diving, and a slightly higher life cycle cost due to the increased volume of water that must be heated and treated, as well as increased energy consumption associated with larger pumping, filtration and heating equipment.\n\t \nThe next step in the proposal process includes soliciting a “best and final” proposal from the design builder whose submitted proposal offered the best value (scored the highest points against stated evaluation criteria), so that administration can bring forth a recommendation of contract award in the coming months.  In order to do so, we must circle back to site administration and staff to finalize pool configurations (i.e., diving or not) and identify the deteriorated and/or suspected conditions that should be included in the contract.\n\t \nIn order to achieve a satisfactory project outcome that will stand the test of time, make best use of available yet limited funds, provide equity of aquatic program opportunity to East Side students (not only among East Side’s schools, but also schools in adjacent districts against whom East Side students compete), and achieve the lowest life cycle cost against future general funds, administration recommends the Board of Trustees augment the project budget in an amount not to exceed $7.2 million – which would allow administration to pursue either Option C or D.  \n\t \nThe majority of funding for this augmentation would be residual Bond Measure G interest revenue, which remains unallocated.  As of June 30, 2014, $5,131,188 of interest income is available; administration recommends the Board allocate all residual interest income – including interest earned after June 30 - to partially fund the swimming pool project budget augmentation.  The remainder of funding needed would not exceed $2,068,812, and would come out of Board discretionary Measure E proceeds.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot to exceed $7.2 million\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure G residual interest revenue ($5,131,188)\nMeasure E Board discretionary funds (not to exceed $2,068,812)\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees augment the Swimming Pool Modernization project budget in an amount not to exceed $7.2 million, funded by Measure G residual interest revenue ($5,131,188 plus amounts earned subsequent to June 30, 2014), and Measure E Board discretionary funds not exceeding $2,068,812.\n",
