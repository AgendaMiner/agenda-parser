I am so proud of them and their Coach Chioke Robinson for the dedication and commitment to making this relay team the best they could be.\n\t \nBelow is the article from the Mercury News:\nThe Piedmont Hills 4x400 relay team knocked three seconds off its own Central Coast Section record at Friday's state meet trials, and then, incredibly, brought the 1-day-old record down another three seconds at Saturday's state meet finals.\nThe Pirates ran 3:41.14, the No. 2 mark in the nation, to win the state championship, obliterating the CCS record (3:47.81) they set at the Mt. SAC Relays, as well as the 3:44.47 they ran the day before at the trials.\nThe Pirates led throughout. Timarya Baynard ran a 55.4 leadoff leg, and Bianca Bryant, the fourth-place finisher in the 800, was clocked in 55.5 on the second leg. Sprinter Alex Diaz ran a 56.3 third leg, and Ellisa Bryant, the third-place finisher in the open 400, smoked a 53.8 anchor.\n\"I was proud of my team, getting us in good position,'' Ellisa Bryant said. \"I didn't know how far behind they were, how close the next runner was. I was just thinking, 'Give it everything you've got.' I just wanted to win it for my coach and for Piedmont.''\nAfter Friday's record-breaking run at the trials, Piedmont Hills coach Chioke Robinson said he thought the team could go faster, and if it did, would win a state title.\nRobinson turned out to be absolutely on the money.\nThe Pirates became only the third team from Northern California in state meet history to win the girls 4x400 relay. Berkeley in 1974 and Skyline in 1994 were the previous winners.\n\"I just hope we did the CCS proud,'' Robinson said. \"It felt so good to go blow to blow with Southern California.''\nHe made one change in the relay order, moving Diaz from fourth to third and Ellisa Bryant from third to anchor.\n\"I don't think it mattered what order we ran in,'' Robinson said. \"But with (Ellisa) graduating, I decided, let her bring it home. She did that.''\n",

After qualifying for the 1,600 at Friday's preliminaries, he said he knew it might be a stretch, but he would like to finish in the top three in the finals and break 4:10.\nThat turned out to be a modest wish.\nVasquez, unleashing the remarkable last-lap kick that has come to be his late-season trademark, went from seventh place at the start of the final lap to second at the finish line with a 58-second fourth lap, and was clocked in 4:08.44.\nVasquez has brought his best time in the 1,600 down 10 seconds the last two weeks, from 4:18.23 to 4:12.58 in winning the Central Coast Section championship and then down to Saturday's 4:08.44 in taking second at state. At that rate, give him a couple more races and he'll break the four-minute mile.\n\"In one race I decided to kick as fast as I could and I liked the way it felt,'' Vasquez said. \"Since then I've been working on strengthening my pace.''\n\t\t \nVasquez came back to take seventh in the 800 in 1:53.16, moving up from 12th to seventh on the final lap.\n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n",

From 2002-2010, there were 100 domestic violence related deaths causing incalculable trauma, pain and loss in our community. In fiscal year 2012, 23,700 individuals called local domestic violence crisis hotlines.  A total of 418 survivors and 317 children accessed emergency shelters.\n\t \nIt is critical that all of our school staff are aware of the extent of the problem and know what resources are available to the victims of domestic violence.  Staff will need to be trained to recognize if the student is being exposed to domestic violence and teen dating violence so that they can then connect them to the appropriate services.  \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees Adopt Resolution #2012/13-37 Schools and Domestic Violence Services\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

This applies to the following credentials or authorizations: Emergency CLAD, BCLAD, Resource Specialist, Library Media, Clinical or Rehabilitative Permits.\n\t \nNow, the Commission issues a permit to an individual who qualifies for an emergency based on the district’s Declaration of Need.  This Declaration, approved by the local Board of Trustees, is submitted to the Commission once a year.  \n\t \nEmergency permits, although originally used primarily to staff partial assignments and special education, now help fill the fully credentialed teacher gap created by class size reduction and statewide teacher shortage.  Every attempt is being made to hire credentialed teachers before considering people on emergency permits.  \n\t \nAttached is the Commission on Teacher Credentialing form titled Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.  Pursuant to direction from the county office of education’s credential’s office, the district is over estimating the number of permits it might require in order to cover any unanticipated needs that might occur during the course of the 2013-2014 school year.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nAs per salary schedule\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nGeneral, Special Education and Adult Education funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, and Kenneth Kerch, AIA, SGI Bond Program Manager\nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of Measure I Planning Process and Timeline, Authorize Allocation of $74.4M Measure I Funding, and Rescission of $20M Measure E Budget Augmentation from Fund 35, Measure G and State Matching Funds\n\t \n\t \nOn November 6, 2012, Santa Clara County voters approved Measure I authorizing the East Side Union High School District to issue general obligation bonds up to $120 million to upgrade computer/science labs; improve security/safety; repair, equip, and construct classrooms/facilities at Andrew Hill, Calero, Evergreen Valley, Foothill, Independence, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, Yerba Buena, W.C. Overfelt, and District adult, alternative, and charter schools; and acquire property for new schools.  \n\t \nMeasure E Historical Perspective\nWhen Measure E was allocated in 2009, an allocation plan was developed that provided the district with an approach to equitably prioritizing resources (February 19, 2009, Board Item 13.03).\n\t \nIn that Measure E Equity Distribution process, the Board distributed monies to comprehensive high schools based on three weighted criteria:\nAcademic Performance Distribution:  the greatest share was allocated to the lowest academic performers (30%)\nBond Share Distribution:  the greatest share was allocated to campuses that received the least amounts of previous bond measure monies (30%)\nAcademic Master Plan Distribution:  funds were allocated to specific projects based on School Site Council priorities (20%)\nAdditionally, the Board distributed monies to:\nAlternative Education Distribution (10%)\nTechnology Distribution (10%)\n\t \nBy 2011, $274,585,000 of bonds had been issued; the remaining $74,415,000 could not be issued due to decreases in property values.  In consideration, the Board approved a Phase III Equity Allocation to mitigate disparities among sites using Fund 35 and Measure G funds (December 8, 2011, Board Item 14.01).  Phases I and II of Measure E projects are still in progress, and to date no work has commenced on Phase III projects.\n\t \nMeasure I Allocation\nIn December 2012, the Board allocated $10,500,000 of Measure I Board discretionary funds to augment the Swimming Pool Upgrade Project (December 11, 2012, Board Item 16.03).  In April 2013, the Board allocated $1,000,000 of Measure I Board discretionary funds for the leasing and/or construction of the EduCare Silicon Valley facility (April 16, 2013, Board Item 8.02).\n\t \nIn light of the Measure E history and recent authorizations for use of Measure I Board discretionary funds, the following Measure I allocation model is offered for Board consideration.  At all times Measure I funds will be used only for those purposes approved by the voters. \n\t \nMeasure I:  $120,000,000\nBoard discretionary allocation for Swimming Pools Modernization Project\n$  10,500,000\nBoard discretionary allocation for EduCare Silicon Valley Early Learning Career Academy\n$    1,000,000\nAllocation for voter-approved Measure I uses that also restores previously Board-approved but unfulfilled Measure E allocations\n$  74,415,000\nDistribution to Sites\n$  34,085,000\n\t \n\t \nThe above allocation is possible because many of the voter-approved Measure I projects also overlap with unfulfilled Measure E projects.  \n\t \nUnder this proposed Measure I allocation model:\nMeasure I funds would be used for voter-approved Measure I projects while also simultaneously effectively restoring $74,415,000 of unfulfilled Measure E Board approved site allocations.  Thus, this proposed use of Measure I is not new site allocation; it is a restoration of Board-approved but unfulfilled allocation from February 2009 under Measure E in a way that is consistent with the Measure I bond.  Restoring these funds would facilitate fulfillment of the original intent of the Board approved site allocations but with Measure I funds now that such funding is available.  \n$34,085,000 of Measure I funds would be allocated to school sites in the coming months, following a weighted criteria system similar to the one used in February 2009 for Measure E.  \n$32,100,000 of Measure I funds used to restore “Land Acquisition” and “Board-Cabinet Contingency” at the District site would be used to fund and supplement infrastructure projects.  \nSince Measure I funds would now be allocated towards $74,415,000 of unfulfilled Measure E projects, the “Phase III Equity Allocations” that were Board approved on December 8, 2011 (agenda item and Board action 14.01(3)) totaling $20,000,000 and funded by Fund 35 ($2M), Measure G ($2M), and State matching funds anticipated in early 2012 ($12M), and State matching funds expected in 2013 ($4M), which were a stopgap measure introduced as a result of the inability to issue the final series of Measure E bonds, can now be rescinded by this Board.  Per the December 2011 analysis and recommendation by staff to the Board, the augmentation was not anticipated to be necessary until mid-2013.  If that December 2011 Board action is now rescinded as recommended, then those funds would then be available for District discretionary initiatives, including payoff of loans that funded installation of solar photovoltaic systems. \n\t \nFuture Measure E proceeds from bond sales of $74,415,000 in approximately 2020, when property value increases allow for remaining Measure E bond issuances, would become Board discretionary funds (absent other Board action). \n\t \nMeasure I Planning Process\n\t \nAn inclusive and collaborative planning process has already begun, to identify needs and develop recommendations for how to use Measure I allocations.  The process would build upon the planning work completed in 2008/2009 for Measure E, and implement the planning, recommendation and approval process put in place for Measure E, as follows:\nHistorical Analysis \nA review of past planning initiatives is in progress to ascertain projects that were identified, prioritized, and either implemented or deferred; those planning initiatives include the 2004 Facilities Master Plan, facilities condition and infrastructure studies, as well as previous Bond Measures A, the second A, G and E plans and outcomes.\nInfrastructure Condition Studies\nHistorical infrastructure studies and analysis will be supplemented with additional survey work to identify a global infrastructure strategy for long term needs with associated cost projections.  The highest priority needs should be included on School Site Council Project and Priority Lists for consideration.\nSchool Site Council Project and Priority Lists \nHistorical analysis reports and updated infrastructure studies will be reviewed by District and Site administration, and School Site Councils.  School Site Councils will work with Facilities Planning staff to update their project and priority lists.  Project and priority lists will be informed by recommendations identified through the Strategic Planning Initiative.\n\t \nIf School Site Councils require assistance in this matter, Facilities Planning staff may engage professional service providers (such as master planners) for assistance.\nSuperintendent’s Council Engagement\nSite project and priority lists will be presented by Site Administration and Facilities Planning to Superintendent’s Council for review and recommendation.\nBoard of Trustees Approval\nOnce School Site Council and Superintendent’s Council are aligned on proposed project and priority lists, they will be presented to the Board of Trustees for approval.\n\t \nTimeline\nThe following timeline is proposed:\nHistorical analysis:  April - May 2013\nMeasure I Allocation Model development and approval:  April – June 2013\nInfrastructure condition analysis:  May – October 2013\nSchool Site Council project and priority lists:  May - October 2013\nSuperintendent’s Council review and recommendation of School Site Council project and priority lists:  November - December 2013\nBoard of Trustees approval of School Site project and priority lists:  January 2014\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n$108,500,000                                          \n                                                                          \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure I general obligation bond funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees:\nAuthorize the allocation of $74,415,000 of Measure I funds for Measure I uses that would also  restore previously Board-approved Measure E site allocations in the same amount;\nRescind the Phase III Equity Allocation Budget Augmentation totaling $20,000,000 from Fund 35, Measure G and anticipated State Matching Funds which was approved by Board action on December 8, 2011, Agenda Item and Board action 14.01(3);\nAuthorize staff to proceed with the Measure I Planning Process and timeline delineated in this report;

Funk, Superintendent\nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, and Kenneth Kerch, AIA, SGI Bond Program Manager\nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action to Update the Facilities Master Plan for Independence High School\n\t \nThe original 1969 Educational Specifications for Independence High School (IHS), by Davis MacConnell Ralston, contemplated a large site with four schools within the school, and the four “villas” that became the basis of the campus design was a manifestation of this educational specification.  In 2004, Perkins & Will developed an updated Facilities Master Plan (FMP) for IHS; the plan called for existing building modernizations for buildings that had not been modernized under previous bond programs.  The plan also called for construction of new restrooms at the L complex, a new Library/Media Center where portable buildings housing KIPP Charter School currently exist, and a new Public Library on the southern end of the campus between the Theater and the Art Complex.  To date, only the new Public Library has been constructed, and it is at the southwest corner of the campus.\n\t \nWith the passage of time since the 2004 FMP, the subsequent modernization plans made in 2008-09 for the Measure E bond program, voter approval of Measure I in November 2012, together with academic delivery innovations that have been identified and are being further developed with the District’s Strategic Planning Initiative, an updated FMP is in order to ensure that facilities improvements are aligned with academic strategies.  \n\t \nThe unique challenges and opportunities presented at Independence High School are as follows:\nThe original “villa” concept was for 4 separate schools, 4 separate administrations.  The site capacity of 4000 was to be separated into 1500-student villas, each individually administered.  Each villa housed principals, counselors, an attendance secretary, assembly halls, classrooms and support spaces, restrooms, and serving kitchens.  In reality, there were equity issues, factionalism, and operational inefficiencies.  Eventually, the concept of 4 separate schools went away; the villas now accommodate grade classes, not separate schools, and administration is centralized.  While improving operational efficiencies, there are challenges associated with serving such a large student body on an expansive campus.\nThe large student population of 3100 students provides the benefit of an expanded curriculum. Student survey results are very positive about the quality of instruction, and how students feel connected to the school. Parent survey results are also satisfactory.  However, there are operational challenges associated with that size population, including the ability to provide personalized attention, and the physical challenge of accommodating the student body in centralized locations for student support services or events.\nExternal IHS and District pressures include:\n2013 demographic study shows IHS area population growth in 7-10 years.  The study also shows an outflow trend of IHS students to charter schools.\nFiscal burden of outsourcing special education to the County Office of Education, and the missed opportunity of integrating and serving those students – where possible – at our high schools.\nFacility issues at IHS:\nThe street address of 1776 Education Park Drive implies that the Education Park Drive side of the campus is the “front”.  That west end of campus is in reality less accessible than the N. Jackson Avenue east side of the campus, which nearly everyone treats as the “front” of the campus.  The west side of the campus presents a more difficult vehicular approach, and the approach through neighboring properties to the east side of campus is more direct.  Further, external organizations (Adult Education, Pegasus, KIPP, San Jose State University, County Office of Education) have a stronger physical presence on the west side than Independence High School itself.  \nThe lack of continuous fencing at IHS leaves the campus exposed and vulnerable from the east, west and south.  \nThe IHS campus is expansive, does not have intuitive pedestrian pathways or sightlines, or wayfinding signage to compensate.  It is easy for visitors and students to get lost.  \nTo date, the capital construction program has not produced any new buildings.  Modernization projects have produced updated \"old feeling\" buildings.\nDesire for a student union / learning center for innovative academic delivery.\nFacility opportunities that would be explored in an updated FMP include but are not limited to the following items  (refer to Attachment A campus map):\nDevelop a strong entrance experience on the eastern (N. Jackson Avenue) side of the campus.\nImprove the outdoor experience with improved hardscape/landscape/wayfinding signage to facilitate navigation.\nRelocate administration to the Jackson side of campus, for improved accessibility.  Develop a new/replacement building(s) on the Jackson side -- not for capacity, but for efficiency, functionality, and architecture that facilitates modern, innovative approaches to academic support delivery, including program spaces for administration, a student center, a student store, finance, a health clinic, and conference space for parent meetings.\nReduce the expansive size of IHS; physically reduce the footprint by creating separation from the entities on the west side of the campus.  The external entity “buffer zone” on the west side of the campus would improve security for IHS, and also further reinforce that Jackson is the “front” of the campus.\nModernize the former library building as a facility for the delivery of special services, with anticipated occupancy in academic year 2016-17 (due to occupancy by others in the prior academic year; see below).  Provide special education classrooms and a central learning lab, with program spaces for students with moderate to severe disabilities.  Efficiency would be realized due to centralization.  Yet due to adjacency, students would have enhanced opportunities for inclusion in the least restrictive environment, through participation with typical peers in classes on the IHS campus proper (e.g. art, music, etc.).\nIntroduce a dependent charter school to curtail the outflow of students to independent charter schools and simultaneously reduce the population at Independence by 400 to 600 students.  The dependent charter school would be a separate school, but by virtue of its adjacency the students could participate in certain aspects of IHS like sports, theater, ASBs.  A new facility at the southeast corner of the IHS site would allow for adjacency yet separation, as well as yet another opportunity to modernize the campus on the Jackson Avenue frontage. The modernized former public library building could house the freshman class in academic year 2015-16, while the new facility is under development.\nThe significant fire damage resulting from the March 3rd fire at Villa B presents an opportunity for reassessment in the larger context of facilities master planning. \nIHS School Site Council met on May 7, 2013 and gave approval to update their facilities master plan.  Superintendent’s Council discussed and reviewed the matter, and recommends an updated FMP for IHS.\n\t \nThe proposed preliminary timeline for an updated IHS facilities master plan is as follows:\nMaster plan RFQ/P:  June 2013\nContract award:  June 2013\nMaster planning:  July – December 2013\nBoard approval:  January 2014                                                                            \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize administration to solicit proposals for facilities master planning at Independence High School, bring forth a recommendation for a facilities master planning contract award at the June 27th Board meeting, and proceed with the updated facilities master planning initiative per the delineated timeline.\n",
