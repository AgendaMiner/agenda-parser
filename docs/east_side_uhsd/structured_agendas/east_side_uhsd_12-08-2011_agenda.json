The Board directed staff to evaluate options for augmenting an anticipated $90 Million Measure E Bond sale with $20 Million drawn from a combination of the District’s Fund 35 and unallocated Measure G Bond proceeds. The total available funding of $110 Million would result in full realization of “Alternative A”. The Board also directed staff to provide additional information on when this funding augmentation would be required.
