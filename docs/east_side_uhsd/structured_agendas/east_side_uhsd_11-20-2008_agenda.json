Per Board Bylaw 9223, when a vacancy occurs four or more months before the end of a Board member's term, the Board shall, within 60 days of the date of the vacancy or the filing of the member's deferred resignation, either order an election or make a provisional appointment.  If no election is ordered, then the Board will make a provisional appointment.Board Bylaw 9223 specifies that the Board shall advertise in the local media to solicit “candidate applications or nominations.”  Thus, the Board must decide whether it will seek applications or nominations for the upcoming Board vacancy.  Per Board Bylaw 9223, the Board must also establish the timeline and the rules for the selection of the provisional appointees, and approve an application and a set of questions for all candidates to answer in writing.  The Board must also appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of less than a quorum of the Board to ensure that applicants are eligible for Board membership as required by law.  The applications of all eligible candidates will be forwarded to all Board members. The Board may appoint an advisory committee to, at a public meeting, review applications, interview candidates and make recommendations to the Board. The Board is not restricted by the advisory committee’s recommendation and may appoint any of the eligible applicants. The Board shall interview the candidates, of it’s choosing from the list of eligible applicants, at a public meeting, accept oral or written public input, and select the provisional appointee by a majority vote.FISCAL IMPACT:To be determined.FUNDING SOURCE:Not ApplicableRECOMMENDATION:Take action consistent with Board Bylaw 9223 to determine: (1) whether to seek applications or nominations to the pending Board vacancy; (2) authorize and direct Administration to advertise in the local media to solicit such applications/nominations to fill the pending Board vacancy; (3) determine the timeline and rules for the selection of the provisional appointee; and (4) approve an application and a set of questions for all candidates to answer in writing.",
