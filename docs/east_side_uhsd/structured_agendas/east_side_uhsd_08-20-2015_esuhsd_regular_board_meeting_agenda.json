This amount is slightly less than the $6.1 billion proposed in the Governor’s May Revision. This appropriation reduces the funding gap for district LCFF targets to 51.5 percent from 53.08%.  East Side’s LCFF funding is expected to decrease by $1.89 million through fiscal year 2017-18.  \n\t \nOne-time Discretionary Funding \nThe final Budget Act provides $3.2 billion or $530 per ADA for K-12 school districts. This amount is slightly less than the $3.5 billion or $601 per ADA provided in the Governor’s May revision.  The outstanding mandate repayment backlog now stands to be $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion for schools and about $300 million for community colleges). The final budget indicates that these are one-time funds that can be used at the discretion of local school districts.  Fiscal year 2015-16 one-time discretionary revenues for ESUHSD are expected to decline by $1.604 million.   \n\t \nLottery \nThe original projection for unrestricted lottery at the May revision was $128 per ADA.  With the elimination of the Adult Education and Regional Occupational Center/Program ADA as part of the State lottery formula, the Lottery projected funding for 2015-16 is now projected at $181 per ADA ($140 unrestricted and $41 Proposition 20).  Unrestricted lottery funding for ESUHSD is expected to increase by $826 thousand through fiscal year 2017-18. \n\t \nEducator Effectiveness (Restricted Dollars)  \nThe budget provides $500 million to school districts for the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of instructional staff and school leadership.  The dollars are to be used for beginning teacher and administrator support and mentoring; professional development, coaching, and support services for teachers who have been identified as needing improvement or additional support; professional development for teachers and administrators that is aligned to the State academic content standards; Promote educator quality and effectiveness, including, but not limited to; training on mentoring and coaching certificated staff and training certificated staff to support effective teaching and learning.  ESUHSD is projecting $1.7 million for the Teacher Effectiveness initiative, which are designated as restricted funds.  \n\t \nRoutine Restricted Maintenance \nThe Governor’s final budget permits through 2019-20 a phase-in of school district contributions to routine restricted maintenance accounts (no less than 2 percent by 2017-18 and 3 percent by 2020-21) and allows funds to be used for drought mitigation purposes.  The Adopted Budget for East Side allocates 3 percent, beginning in FY 2015-16 through FY 2017-18.  The District has the option to cap routine restricted maintenance dollars at the current 2015-16 level.  \n\t \nEXPENSES \nIn relation to expenses, there were some major increases in the District’s expenses.  At Budget Adoption, the Board approved the addition of 4.625 FTE custodians for a total increase of $1 million through fiscal year 2017-18.  The District also recently received a special education disproportionately ruling, which will increase the fiscal year 2015-16 budget by an estimated $589,676.  The District’s health benefits consultant Gallagher and Company recently notified the District that we should budget for increased expenditures totaling $850,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 due to the Cadillac tax provision within the Affordable Care Act, which goes into effect on January 1, 2018.   Lastly, Educational Services Division has requested a $200,000 budget augmentation to pilot textbooks in fiscal year 2015-16.  The total increase in expenditures for the multi-year period between fiscal year 2015-16 through fiscal year 2017-18 totals $2.56 million in the unrestricted General Fund.  \n\t \nSummary  \nIn summary, the net effect on the District’s unrestricted General Fund Revenues totals a net loss of $2.6 million.  Total expenses are expected to increase by $2.56 million.  Overall, the District’s unrestricted financial reserves are projected to decline from 9.66% to 7.73% by fiscal year 2017-18 as a result of the budget revisions noted.   \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the budget revisions to the 2015-16 adopted budget for budgetary planning purposes only.\n",

OpTerra has identified $5.2 million of eligible projects, with a  SIR of 1.11, which will qualify for Proposition 39 funds (refer to Attachment B “Proposition 39 Funding Eligibility Test”).  \n\t\t\t\t \nThis Energy Services Contract includes a savings and performance guarantee of $6,214,498 over 15 years, as follows:\nSolar kWh guaranteed by OpTerra for 15 years\nEnergy conservation savings guaranteed by OpTerra for 15 years\n\t\t\t\t \nIn addition to the guaranteed energy savings the District will realize from this project, OpTerra’s proposal includes the following value-added benefits:\nImproved indoor environmental comfort and function\nDecreased disruption to learning and working environments due to equipment failures\nDecreased maintenance burden\nEconomic stimulus through creation of 11 direct and over 100 indirect green construction jobs\nEducational enrichment through internships and custom educational programming that supports Common Core implementation, enhances career pathways, and boosts professional development\nContinuation of East Side’s leadership position in energy conservation\nEnvironmental benefits of avoiding more than 2,305 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year\n\t\t\t\t \nFunding for this initiative is as follows:\n\t\t\t\t \nProposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Creation           $  4,958,554 \nUtility Rebates                                                        $      100,463\nSchool Facilities Fund 35                                       $     166,694\nTotal               $  5,225,711\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nThe California Clean Energy Jobs Act was created with the approval of Proposition 39 in the November 2012 statewide General Election.  Proposition 39 allocates projected revenue to the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund for five fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 2013/14.  Allocations are made to schools and/or districts based on enrollment.  Applications for eligible projects are submitted to the California Energy Commission – the agency responsible for Proposition 39 oversight; upon completion of the approved projects, funds are disbursed.  OpTerra’s proposed scope package includes administering the applications, measurement and verification, and claims processes on the District’s behalf.  OpTerra will similarly administer utility rebate program applications, measurement and verification, and claims processes with PG&E.  Since Proposition 39 and utility rebate funds are not currently in hand, but will be secured in the coming months and through fiscal year 2017-18, the District will use School Facilities Fund 35 to bridge the funding gap until we receive Pro   position 39 and utility rebate proceeds.  The Proposition 39 funding allocations for fiscal years 2013-14 and 2014-15 are known and available as soon as the project is completed; the allocations are unknown for the following three years.  The funding amount indicated for Proposition 39 and the associated Fund 35 bridge funding are based on conservative projections.\n\t\t\t\t \nThe terms of the Program Development Agreement between the District and OpTerra provide that OpTerra shall receive a $60,000 Assessment Fee for their work of the Program Development Phase; the terms further provide that if the District enters into an Energy Services Contract with OpTerra, this Assessment Fee shall be incorporated into the total contract amount payable under the Energy Services Contract (Attachment C).\n\t\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$5,225,711\n\t\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nProposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Creation\n$4,958,554 *\nBoard approved March 20, 2014, Board Item 9.06.\nFunding is provided after energy measures are implemented, measured and verified.\n*Note:  Projected total allocation in fiscal years 2013-14 through 2017-18.  The actual amount of Proposition 39 proceeds awarded in fiscal years 2015-16 through 2017-18 is not known at this time. \nUtility Rebates\n$100,463\nFunding is provided after energy measures are implemented, measured and verified.\nSchool Facilities Fund 35\n$5,225,711*\nFund 35 will be used to bridge the funding gap until the District receives Proposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Creation and utility rebate proceeds.\n*Note:  This amount is a projection.  The actual amount of Proposition 39 proceeds awarded in FY2015-16 through 2017-18 is not known at this time.  Amounts not reimbursed by Proposition 39 and Utility Rebate funds will be funded out of School Facilities Fund 35, projected to be $166,694.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that, pursuant with Government Code section 4217.10 – 4217.18 and on the basis of the foregoing and the materials and analysis presented, the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2015-2016-01: (i) finding and determining that the anticipated cost to the District for thermal or electrical energy or conservation services provided by the energy conservation facility under the proposed contract with OpTerra will be less than the anticipated marginal cost to the District of thermal, electrical, or other energy that would have been consumed by the District in the absence of those purchases, (ii) authorizing the Associate Superintendent of Business Services to execute an Energy Services Contract with OpTerra Energy Services in an amount not to exceed $5,225,711, to provide energy saving measures, administer Proposition 39 Clean Energy Jobs Act and utility rebate funding processes, administer an associated educational enrichment program, and provide support and assistance with an energy conservation media campaign;
