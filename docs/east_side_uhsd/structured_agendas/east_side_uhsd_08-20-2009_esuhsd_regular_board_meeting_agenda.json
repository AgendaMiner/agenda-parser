QSCBs are an interest-free financing vehicle for the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation or repair of K-12 school facilities.  The Stimulus Bill authorizes the nation-wide issuance of $11 billion of QSCBs in 2009 and an additional $11 billion in 2010.For 2009, California has been allocated $1.36 billion in QSCB funding with an equal amount anticipated in 2010.  Under Federal regulations, $582 million of the 2009 California QSCB program is directly allocated to the eleven largest/poorest districts in the State.  For all other districts, the allocation of the remaining $774 million is being administered by the California Department of Education (“CDE”).  Of this amount, $74 million is being set aside for use by charter schools.The CDE is accepting QSCB applications (with a $25 million cap per district) through August 25, 2009.  If at the end of this period, the allocation requests exceed the $700 million, a lottery will be held and awards made on August 28, 2009. DiscussionWhile the prospect of interest-free financing is attractive and has generated significant interest among the State’s school districts, the amount borrowed under the QSCB program must still be repaid within a 15-year timeframe – a daunting prospect given today’s budgetary crisis.  The District’s financial advisor, Dale Scott & Company, and bond counsel, Jones Hall, have developed a method by which the District’s General Obligation Bond authorization can be used as a vehicle for the repayment of the QSCB borrowing at a significant benefit to the District and its taxpayers.  In addition, if structured correctly, the use of QSCBs could result in significant additional project funds being available to the District at no additional cost to taxpayers.Should the District receive a QSCB allocation from the State, this program will allow for the acceleration of many of the District’s proposed projects (in keeping the guiding purpose of the Stimulus Bill) at a reduced cost to taxpayers. The District has an immediate need for QSCB funding and our population and local economy will greatly benefit from the construction projects generated by this program.  The attached resolution is designed to accompany our application to the State and allow bond counsel to prepare documentation required for subsequent bond issuance if said application is approved.  If, after applying and receiving an allocation, the District decides not to use all or a part of the allocation for whatever reason, it can be returned without penalty to the State.  Any subsequent financings that take place due to receipt of a QSCB allocation by the District will be brought to the Board for approval.  All professional fees and expenses associated with the QSCB application process and subsequent transactions are wholly contingent on the successful completion of the necessary financings and under no circumstances will to be paid out of the District’s general fund.  FISCAL IMPACT:N/AFUNDING SOURCE:N/ARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended the Board of Trustees Approve Resolution 2009/2010-02 Authorizing District Staff to submit an application for QSCBs.\n",

Perkins 132 Grant 2009-10 Grant Application for East Side Adult Education ProgramOverview:The East Side Adult Education Program is part of a five program Career Technical Education consortium to receive Carl Perkins funding.  Under its guidelines adult education agencies who can not generate $50,000 in grant funding may apply for funding under a consortium model.  The four partners in the consortium are Metropolitan Adult Education, Mountain View-Los Altos Adult Education, Santa Clara Adult Education, and Sunnyvale-Cupertino Adult Education.  With the assistance of our consortium members, the East Side Adult Education has served as the lead partner in this consortium and is charged with submitting the application, monitoring the progress toward goal achievement, and evaluating the Carl Perkins plan annually.Accomplishments:Utilizing information for Central Santa Clara County from the Employment Development Department, input from the five Adult Education Program Advisory Committees, and staff and student surveys, the CTE Consortium Advisory Committee identified two industry sectors and related career pathways addressed in this five year plan.  Perkins funds will be used to assist programs in Health and Science which will focus on Clinical Nursing, Medical Assistant, and Home Health Aide Assistant career pathways.  The second industry sector is Information Technology, which will focus on Administrative Assistant, Database Administrator, Support & Services Technician, Desktop Publishing, and Accounting career pathways.  The adult education programs in the consortium offer a thriving program for the completion of a secondary education and English language development and providing career learning opportunities in health, medicine, and information technology that have numerous entry and advancements options will complement our programs.
