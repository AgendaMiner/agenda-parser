The ongoing gap in revenues and spending continues to place an undue burden on educators, and threatens to compromise the quality of public education in the state; and WHEREAS, other state budget proposals threaten more than 430,000 private sector, school and local government jobs, while cutting $4.3 billion in Proposition 98 spending to schools and childcare programs; andWHEREAS, the California Jobs Budget, introduced by Assembly Speaker John A. PĂŠrez, takes a radically different approach toward resolving the state’s budget deficit by creating and saving jobs while closing the deficit.  The California Jobs Budget includes a $10.1 billion jobs and economic stability fund that will protect against the loss of these jobs; andWHEREAS, the California Jobs Budget protects public school funding.  The California Jobs Budget rejects the $4.3 billion in Proposition 98 cuts found in other budget proposals and instead fully funds the state’s constitutional requirement; and  WHEREAS, the California Jobs Budget will ensure that $3.8 billion would be repaid to local school districts.  This protects tens of thousands of jobs for teachers, aides and counselors—a step which is good for the local community and the local business community.NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the East Side Union High School District supports the California Jobs Budget as proposed, and encourages the State Legislature and the Governor to adopt this budget without delay.  PASSED AND ADOPTED this 22nd day of June 2010 by the Governing Board of the East Side Union High School District at its Regular Meeting held at 830 N. Capitol Avenue, San Jose, State of California.

The Teaching American History Gran Program is a discretionary grant program funded under Title II-C, Subpart 4 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The goal of the program is to support programs that raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of American history.  The program is designed to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge and understanding of and appreciation for traditional U.S. history. Grant awards will assist LEAs, in partnership with entities that have content expertise, to develop, document, evaluate, and disseminate innovative and cohesive models of professional development. By helping teachers to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of U.S. history as a separate subject matter within the core curriculum, these programs will improve instruction and raise student achievement.Selection Process Prior to submitting the grant application, ESUHSD did not do any type of solicitation/bidding process. Professional Development went with a local (California) evaluation service provider with a long track record of co-authoring and securing Teaching American History competitive grants.  However, in the future, all efforts will be made to do a competitive solicitation process, when necessary, prior to writing grants that name specific providers in the grant application.RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Contract Services Agreement with Anodyne Professional Development Systems, Inc. for the Term October 1, 2009 through and including August 31, 2012 for the provision of evaluation services to East Side Union High School District U.S. History Teachers during Summer Institutes and to delegate authority to the Interim Superintendent or designee to amend said contract on an as needed basis, including funding.   2.

TCI was named in the Grant Proposal as a sole provider of professional development and curriculum materials.  TCI has designed this material specifically around ESUHSD’s Social Studies State standards and multiple learning styles.  No other provider is able to furnish ESUHSD the products and professional development services that TCI can provide to ESUHSD’s teachers.  Therefore, TCI is considered to be a “sole-source” provider for this project.RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Contract Services Agreement with Teachers’ Curriculum Institute for the Term October 1, 2009 through and including August 31, 2012 for professional development and standards-based instructional materials to East Side Union High School District U.S. History Teachers during Summer Institutes and to delegate authority to the Interim Superintendent or designee to amend said contract on an as needed basis, including funding.3.

Educational services shall be consistent with the master contract and specified services per the student’s Individual Education Program (IEP) plan. Currently there is only 1 East Side Union High School Student receiving services at Bay School.Reason for the Purchase of Outside Services.Due to the lack of appropriate articulation with the ESUHSD, Evergreen School District served a student since his first grade year at this school located in Santa Cruz, which specializes in the instruction of extremely involved Autistic students.  At the December 10, 2009 Board meeting, the Board approved a contract with Bay School to provide Non-Public School (NPS) services for a special education student. It was anticipated at that time that the student would be moved at the end of the semester (January 2010) into a more local NPS offering similar services.  However, due to circumstances beyond the District’s control, the student was not able to be moved and remained at this NPS for the entire school year.The original contract expired on January 22, 2010; therefore ESUHSD must issue a new contract and purchase order in order to pay Bay School for their services that they have already provided to this special education student from January 23, 2010 through and including August 31, 2010.Selection Process There was no competitive solicitation done for this service.  The Bay School was selected by Evergreen School District to meet this student’s needs in elementary school.It is an NPS that offers specialized educational services for Autistic students. RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve a Contract Services Agreement with The Bay School for the contract term January 23, 2010 through and including August 31, 2010 for the provision of Non-Public School Services for a Special Education Student and to delegate authority to the Interim Superintendent or designee to amend said contract on an as needed basis, including funding. 4.

The original contract and amendment/change order #1 was based on a specific number of students who had already been placed at Pine Hill School.  However, since that time, the number of students referred and placed at Pine Hill School has increased and the funding needs to increase in order to pay for the services provided to these additional students and to cover the services to be provided during the months of July and August.Selection ProcessNo solicitation process has taken place either at the initiation of this Contract nor at this time.  Students are referred and placed to alternative schools based on IEP hearings.  ESUHSD is required to pay the school portion of the placement.

ManagerAlan GarofaloDonna BertrandN/A$147,860.00 Measure E FundsAlan Garofalo, Associate Superintendent of Student Services and FacilitiesEast Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) is requesting authorization from the Board of Trustees to approve the purchase of one 12x40 DSA approved relocatable steel rigid frame construction, Type V non-rated construction, 20 lb roof load – 80 mph wind load – 70 lb floor load. This relocatable unit will be used for the James Lick Fire Service Center Project.Selection Process ESUHSD is requesting approval to purchase the above described DSA Modular Restroom/Concession Building using the piggyback bid from the Santa Rita Union School District.  The original bid was completed and awarded by Santa Rita’s Board of Trustees at their December 15, 2005 Board Meeting to American Modular Systems (AMS).  The contract with AMS has been renewed each year after that.  The current extension goes through December 31, 2010.However, to ensure that ESUHSD is receiving the best pricing ESUHSD did a comparison of other piggyback bids and the results are as follows:American Modular SystemsMobile ModularWilliams Scotsman$147,860.00$165,000.00$210,000.00RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the purchase of one 12x40 DSA Approved Modular Restroom/ Concession Building in the amount of $147,000.00 from American Modular Sytems through the use of the Santa Rita Union School District’s piggyback bid (in accordance with Public Contract Code 20118 & 20118.2).  14.  AMS.NET  Reviewed by:Contract PeriodCost/Fund SourceSchool/Dept. ManagerAlan GarofaloJerry KurrDonna BertrandN/A$224,228.04 (increase amount) Measure E FundsDennis Barbata, DirectorEast Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) is requesting authorization from the Board of Trustees to approve Changed Order #1 to Purchase Order #001320 with AMS.NET in the amount of $224,288.04 for the completion of the Network Infrastructure Upgrade and Telecommunications Systems and to delegate authority to the Interim Superintendent to modify Purchase Order as needed, including funding.In the Summer of 2009 ESUHSD conducted a public Request for Proposal (RFP) process (RFP-04-08-09) where AMS.Net was awarded by the Board of Trustee’s at the September 17, 2009 Board meeting approved Administration’s recommendation to award the RFP to AMS.NET.  The original amount of the award was for $9,539,744.59.This Change Order #1 is needed in order for the current projects to be completed.  AMS.NET and CISCO have agreed to provide ESUHSD with the same pricing that we received from the competitive RFP process completed back in the summer 2009.  In an attempt to try and capture the entire list of components that would be necessary for a project the size of ESUHSD’s was quite a task.  It took ESUHSD months to come up with the plan on how this project would be completed.  Once the planning was completed, the identification of the many parts and pieces was conducted and the RFP documents were prepared and sent out.  It was not until after the award of the project when the Vendor and ESUHSD staff were conducting the various site walks and after the project has begun did ESUHSD and the Vendor realize how much was accidentally left off of the RFP parts list.  Some were missing parts and some were missing locations that were inadvertently left off.  ESUHSD waited until the project was at least half way completed before coming back to the Board to request one final Change Order to the Purchase Order. It was our intention to use all extra parts, if any, before requesting the Board to approve the purchase of any additional items under the RFP-04-08-09. Therefore the change we are requesting is $224,288.04. The new total for this Purchase Order will be $9,763,972.63. This amount includes all taxes, labor and parts needed to complete this project. For a project this size, the discrepancy is minimal.RECOMMENDATION:Approve Changed Order #1 to Purchase Order #001320 with AMS.NET in the amount of $224,288.04 for the completion of the Network Infrastructure Upgrade and Telecommunications Systems and to delegate authority to the Interim Superintendent to modify Purchase Order as needed, including funding.  15.
