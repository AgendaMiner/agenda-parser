California,Litigation Challenging the State’s School Finance SystemResolution #2009/2010-49WHEREAS, education is a fundamental right of every child in California; and WHEREAS, California’s constitution requires a public school system that prepares students to become informed citizens and productive members of society; and WHEREAS, California has set clear requirements for what schools are expected to teach and what students are expected to learn; and WHEREAS, the State has an obligation to maintain and support a school finance system that provides districts and county offices of education the resources necessary to meet these requirements; and WHEREAS, California’s school finance system is unsound, unstable, insufficient, and thus unconstitutional; and WHEREAS, the State’s school finance system prevents the East Side Union High School District from providing all of the education programs and services our students need to become proficient in the State’s academic standards and to obtain a well-rounded education; and WHEREAS, as a result of the broken school finance system, students are being denied the opportunity to master the required education program; and WHEREAS, severe budget cuts over the last several years have made a dire situation worse by forcing districts to increase class size, lay off teachers, eliminate many programs necessary to support student learning and well-being; and WHEREAS, the lawsuit, Robles-Wong v. California, filed on May 20, 2010 in Alameda County seeks to remedy the broken school finance system by (1) declaring it unconstitutional and (2) requiring State lawmakers to uphold their constitutional duty to design and implement a school finance system that provides all students equal access to the required education program; and WHEREAS, filing this lawsuit was a last resort — the Governor and lawmakers have known for some time that the current school finance system is harming students, schools and districts, and they have done nothing to remedy the crisis; and WHEREAS, the East Side Union High School District believes it is imperative to provide a sound, stable, and sufficient school finance system so that all children have equal educational opportunities; NOW, THERFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the East Side Union High School District strongly supports Robles-Wong v. California, the litigation challenging the State’s school finance system.

Four of the Title I schools (Andrew Hill, James Lick, W.C. Overfelt and Yerba Buena) are designated as School-wide Title I schools as per board action in 2005.  The schools attained this status due to high number of students (at least 40% of enrollment) on Free/Reduced meals. This year, the remaining five Title I schools (Foothill, Independence, Mt. Pleasant, Oak Grove and Silver Creek) have at least 40 percent of their students eligible for Free/Reduced meals. Therefore, these schools are now qualified to apply to become a School-wide Title I school upon board approval. A School-wide Title I school will have more flexibility in using the allocated funds to support all students.The District Advisory Council (DAC) and the District English Learners Advisory Council (DELAC) have reviewed the school goals, budgets, and plans.

[Section 1114(a)(1) of Title I of ESEA].Whereas, Title I targeted assistance programs only provide educational services to identified individual students, school-wide programs allow staff in schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families to redesign their entire educational program to serve all students. The emphasis in school-wide program schools is on serving all students, improving all structures that support student learning, and combining all resources, as allowed, to achieve a common goal. School-wide programs maximize the impact of Title I. Adopting this strategy should result in an ongoing, comprehensive plan for school improvement that is owned by the entire school community and tailored to its unique needs. Based on current data provided by our food services department, 41% of Oak Grove High School students are eligible for Free/Reduced meals, 60% of Foothill High School students are eligible for Free/Reduced meals, 45% of Silver Creek High School students are eligible for Free/Reduced meals, 41% of Independence High school students are eligible for Free/Reduced meals, and 50% of Mt.

Marine Biology is a third or fourth year of science elective course emphasis on ecology and the world’s marine environment will provide the sort of timeliness and relevance that will attract additional students who might not otherwise choose a third year elective science course.Multimedia Arts III: Multimedia Arts III is an intermediate/advanced level, project-based course that provides students with the opportunity to further explore and refine what they learned in Multimedia Arts I and II. Course emphasis is on time-based design supported by video and audio production tools. Students revisit studies of the integration of text, images, animation and interactivity in the creation of multimedia projects while exploring advanced techniques and concepts in art and technology. Students will further research career and educational pathways, along with developing a professional portfolio and planning the pieces to achieve college entrance or career attainment.

Prior to that time, districts were required to issue individual statements of need for each applicant.  The applicant, in turn, would take the declaration of need to the county office of education for the issuance of an emergency credential. This applies to the following credentials or authorizations: Emergency CLAD, BCLAD, Resource Specialist, Library Media, Clinical or Rehabilitative Permits.Now, the Commission issues a permit to an individual who qualifies for an emergency based on the district’s Declaration of Need.  This Declaration, approved by the local Board of Trustees, is submitted to the Commission once a year.  Emergency permits, although originally used primarily to staff partial assignments and special education, now help fill the fully credentialed teacher gap created by class size reduction and statewide teacher shortage.  Every attempt is being made to hire credentialed teachers before considering people on emergency permits.  Attached is the Commission on Teacher Credentialing form titled Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.  Pursuant to direction from the county office of education’s credential’s office, the district is over estimating the number of permits it might require in order to cover any unanticipated needs that might occur during the course of the 2010-2011 school year.FISCAL IMPACT: As per salary scheduleFUNDING SOURCE: General, Special Education and Adult Education fundsRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators\n",

The Board has previously awarded such lease agreements to carriers Verizon, T-Mobile and Clear Wire.  Antennas potentially would be installed on light poles around the football stadiums at each of those campuses, on rooftops, or as otherwise approved by the District.  Other school districts have entered into such agreements as a means of generating lease income including, most recently, San Jose Unified School District.  Administration seeks the Board’s approval to accept additional lease proposals at all of the District’s sites.At the September 17, 2009, Regular Board Meeting, the Board held a public hearing to solicit community input on the potential leasing of District property for such purposes.  Before Administration can fully negotiate any such lease with any proposed lessee the Board must by 2/3ds vote (4 out of 5 Members) approve a Resolution of Intent to lease property and then advertise the notice of the approved resolution locally, including that the District will be accepting offers to lease such property upon minimum rental terms.  Each lease could generate approximately $24,000 annually, or more.Any offers to lease would be opened and examined at the time of the August 19, 2010, regular Board meeting, and any lease agreements would be subject to final Board approval.FISCAL IMPACT:Lease revenue to be determinedFUNDING SOURCE:N/ARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt the attached Resolution no. #2009/2010-50 by a 2/3rds majority declaring the District’s intent to lease District property as described in the Resolution.

The amount of the financed portion of the project is $14,619,998.  The District sent requests for proposals to six finance agencies and received three proposals in response.  The responses received were from First Security Leasing; Bank of America and Green Campus Corp.  Two of the proposals also included financing under a new offering known as Build America Bond Taxable Lease Purchase.  This program does provide for lease purchase funds at an initial higher taxable interest rate than the non-taxable financing.  However, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) the federal government on an annual basis would reimburse the District 35% of the interest cost which would net a slightly less interest cost to the District than a non taxable lease purchase arrangement.  This reimbursement would have to be requested at the end of each year of principle and interest payments to the leaser.  This would be over the full fifteen year period of lease payback.  Under this program there would not be a provision for an early payback or pay down of the obligation.  Under the Green Campus Corporation offer the Build America Bond program is also a General Obligation Bond proposal with interest rates based upon closing the sale of bonds with the underwriter.  Other than the Bank of America offer the interest rates proposed were not locked.  Staff is recommending not participating in this untested form of financing.  Of the other two proposals that were for a tax exempt lease purchase financing the lowest guaranteed interest rate of 4.51% is from Bank of America.  The Bank of America proposal does include a provision under certain circumstances for early pay-down or payback of the loan.  The staff does recommend accepting the Bank of America proposal.FISCAL IMPACT:$14,619,998.00FUNDING SOURCERetirement of the 15 year Debt will be paid from the project energy cost savingsRECOMMENDATION:It is recommend that the Board of Trustees accept and approve the Bank of America proposal for a tax exempt master equipment lease purchase agreement in the amount of $14,619,998 at an interest rate not to exceed 4.51%.",
