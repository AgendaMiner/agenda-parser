Over the last 2 ½ years the District has pursued its claim for insurance with its insurance carriers and it appears the District may receive approximately $1.3 million in insurance proceeds for the damage.  On August 26, 2006, the Board by unanimous vote approved Resolution 2006/2007-05 finding that the Foothill library fire constituted an emergency situation necessitating immediate remediation and authorizing the Superintendent to enter into contracts for the repair of the Foothill library without having to comply with the state’s public bidding laws.  Reconstruction of the library, including upgrades, has been completed. The prompt reconstruction of the Foothill High School library was accomplished, in part, with Measure G funds and also, in part, with insurance proceeds. To supplement Measure G funds, Administration recommends that the Board approve and direct the expenditure from capital fund Fund 35 of a sum equal to the insurance proceeds received by the District for the loss of the building structure caused by the fire towards the completion of a Measure G project (to be determined).  The expenditure of such funds to take place after the insurance settlement for the building loss is resolved and funds have actually been received by the District.FISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:Fund 35RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and direct the expenditure from capital fund Fund 35 of a sum equal to the insurance proceeds received by the District for the loss of the building structure caused by the fire towards the completion of a Measure G project (to be determined).  The expenditure of such funds from Fund 35 for such purpose shall not take place before the insurance settlement for the building loss is resolved and funds have actually been received by the District.\n",

The Charter Board elected to participate in both STRS and PERS for its employees.  MACSA and the Charter have now acknowledged that the Charter has failed to deposit employee contributions and failed to make matching employer contributions to both STRS and PERS for over a year.  ESUHSD is the chartering authority for Academia Calmecac and is responsible for overseeing the fiscal and financial management of the charter pursuant to its petition.  Education Code section 47607 provides that a charter may be revoked upon a showing of substantial evidence that the charter engaged in fiscal mismanagement or violated any provision of law.  (Educ. Code section 47607(c).)  Prior to revoking a charter a school district shall notify the charter of the alleged violation(s) and provide the charter a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violations.  By letter dated February 25, 2009, the District notified MACSA of the STRS/PERS violations and requested that the violations be cured no later than March 31, 2009.  As of this date, the violations have not been cured. The Education Code provides that prior to revoking a charter for failure to remedy a violation and after expiration of the reasonable opportunity to cure the violation, the District shall provide a written Notice of Intent to Revoke and, no later than 30 days after the Notice of Intent to Revoke, the District shall hold a public hearing to determine whether evidence exists to revoke the charter.

Pleasant, Santa Teresa and Evergreen Valley High Schools, the Project Assignment for the District-Wide Technology Allocation, and the Modernization of the Calero Site - Alan Garofalo, Associate Superintendent of Student Services and FacilitiesBackgroundOn February 19, 2009, the Board reviewed priority projects for Measure E funding summarized in the Project Summary Worksheets presented to the Board for the eleven comprehensive campuses.  The Project Summary Worksheets included Campus project priority rankings and Cabinet priority project rankings, as well as the project budgets.  The Board then approved the Project Summary Worksheets based on the Cabinet priority rankings. Reason for Further Board ActionFollowing project approvals as noted above, the Facilities department selected and launched thirty-one of the ninety-four approved projects.  As part of the Design process, SGI Program Managers met with the Campus administrators and School Site Councils to further define the educational program needs to be met with the construction of these projects.   As a result of those meetings, a few advantageous adjustments to the project priorities, scopes and budgets were identified.  These adjustments are in line with the Board direction given at the February 19th meeting to further evaluate projects on the Independence and Mount Pleasant campuses.Independence Campus:   Staff recommends that the Performing Arts Theater Modernization project be moved from the “On Deck-Unfunded” category to the “Funded” category based on a reduced scope of work resulting in the budget being reduced from $14,409,653 to $5,271,824, as noted in the attached adjusted Project Summary Worksheet dated June 18, 2009.  (Attachment A)Justification:  This project is the top priority for Campus administrators and the School Site Council.  The existing theater suffers from leaks and is in serious need of modernization.Effect on Allocations:  This project, with its scope reduced to essential work, can be funded as part of the previously approved funded projects for the campus without changes to the campus allocation or previously approved projects.Mount Pleasant Campus:  Staff recommends that the modernization of all classrooms and spaces located in Buildings 600 and 800 be moved from the “On Deck-Unfunded” category to the “Funded” category, and that the New Classroom & Multipurpose Building be moved to the bottom of the “Funded” list.  Staff also recommends that modernization of Classroom Buildings 300 and 700 be added to the “Funded” category, and that the project Convert Blds 200,600, and 800 Centers to Classrooms be dropped from the “Funded” category, as noted in the attached adjusted Project Summary Worksheet dated June 18, 2009.   (Attachment B)Justification:  Classroom modernization is a top priority of this campus and the District.  In order to maximize State matching funding, the majority of the classrooms in Buildings 200 (previously approved) as well as those in Buildings 600, 800, 300 and 700 will need to be modernized.    Additionally, this Campus wishes to construct a new classroom building in order to eventually move the Mount Pleasant students housed in the portables to permanent classroom space.Effect on Allocations:  Modernization of Buildings 600, 300 and 700 can be achieved within the original campus allocation.  However the New Classroom & Multipurpose Building project cannot be fully funded within the original campus allocation.  Modernization of Buildings 600, 800, 300 and 700 can be used to leverage State matching funds which may be spent on this campus and are expected to be sufficient to cover the cost of the New Classroom & Multipurpose Building.  Given the uncertain State funding situation, and unmet District priorities for the use of additional funding, staff is recommending that this adjusted project list be approved by the Board as presented here with the note that the New Classroom & Multipurpose Building may be constructed if State funds are received.  Consequently, there would be no change to the original Measure E campus allocation.Santa Teresa Campus:  Staff recommends that the scope of the New Multipurpose Building project be adjusted such that the two 500 square foot seminar rooms included in the original project are designed and constructed as two standard classroom spaces.  The expanded scope is indicated by the adjusted budget for this project noted in the attached adjusted Project Summary Worksheet dated June 18, 2009.  (Attachment C)Justification:  Standard classroom space will provide greater flexibility for use and better serve the campus needs over time.Effect on Allocations:  This project can be funded as part of the previously approved funded projects for the campus without changes to the campus allocation or previously approved projects.Evergreen Valley Campus:  Staff recommends that the scope of the Complete PE Teaching Stations be expanded to include locker room modernization required for code compliance, as noted in the attached adjusted Project Summary Worksheet dated June 18, 2009.  (Attachment D)Justification:  Code compliance is a legal requirement.  Cost efficiencies can be realized by affecting these code upgrades in concert with the PE Teaching Station work.Effect on Allocations:  This project can be funded as part of the previously approved funded projects for the campus without changes to the campus allocation or previously approved projects.Project Assignment for the District Wide Technology AllocationBackgroundThe Information Technology department had previously identified priority technology work, software and equipment needs through the development of the Board approved five year Technology and Education Plan 2009-2012.  On February 19, 2009 the Board approved the Equity Distribution-Measure E document of that date which included a $27,460,000 allocation for District Wide Technology.  As a result, the Information Technology department in concert with the Facilities and Instructional Divisions has moved aggressively to implement the planned work.SGI Program Managers worked with the Information Technology department to assist with project budgeting for the technology allocation.  General and specific project line items and budgets have been identified and summarized in an adjusted Project Summary Worksheet.  (Attachment E)Calero Campus:  Staff recommends that the Board approve the campus allocation previously indicated on the Equity Distribution-Measure E summary document approved on February 19, 2009 and as indicated in the attached Project Summary Worksheet.  (Attachment F)Justification:  This Project Summary Worksheet was not part of the packet of Project Summary Worksheet previously approved on February 19, 2009.Effect on Allocations:  The campus allocation is unchanged from the amount shown on the Equity Distribution-Measure E document dated February 19, 2009.RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Scope and Funding Adjustments to Measure E Projects for Independence, Mt. Pleasant, Santa Teresa and Evergreen Valley High Schools, the Project Assignment for the District-Wide Technology Allocation, and the Modernization of the Calero Site.      ",
