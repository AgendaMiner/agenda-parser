The dual purpose of the national seminars is to provide public school teachers a deeper knowledge of the subjects they teach and first-hand experience with the Teachers Institute approach to high-quality professional development.  This increases their leadership in an existing Teachers Institute or prepares them to lead the development of a new Teachers Institute. Each teacher writes a curriculum unit to teach his or her students about the seminar subject and to share with other teachers in their school district, and over the Internet with teachers anywhere.  The curriculum units implement academic standards of the teachers’ school districts and assist the teachers in engaging and educating their students.  East Side teachers spent two (2) weeks living on the Yale campus and participated in ten (10) two-hour daily seminars and conferred individually with their seminar leaders as they developed the curriculum unit.     \n\t \n",

Approve Resolution #2013/2014-11  re:  Delegation of Authority to Associate Superintendent to Approve Final Form of Sub Lease and Related Agreements for Early Childhood Education Program Facilities for ESUHSD Programs\n\t \n\t \n\t \nAt the direction and authorization of the Board, Legal Counsel and Administration have been in negotiations with representatives of Franklin McKinley School District (FMSD) and Educare of California at Silicon Valley, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (ECSV), and related parties for a lease and related agreements for the construction of a portion of the proposed and planned ECSV facility on FMSD property adjacent to the Santee Elementary School site.  The Board previously approved an allocation of $1,000,000 from Measure I funds towards the construction of the facility which will house an early childhood education career academy for ESUHSD students to be administered by ESUHSD staff.  In addition, the ECSV early childhood education facility, when completed, will include, but not be limited to, delivery of preschool and parenting services and programs, which will allow the District the opportunity to transfer such existing programs to the new ECSV facility and allow opportunities for alternative uses of the existing YBHS facilities.\n\t \nThe ECSV facility will be constructed on land owned by FMSD within the ESUHSD jurisdiction.  ESUHSD will be allocated five (5) classrooms (approximately 5,000 square feet) and ancillary space at the facility for the ESUHSD early childhood education career academy.  The current construction budget for the facility is approximately $12,882,000.  In addition to the District’s contribution, the construction will be funded through a contribution of $800,000 in bond funds from FMSD, funding through the federal New Market Tax Credits program (made available to ECSV) and private fundraising and contributions.  The facility design will be DSA-approved and the design and construction will be compliant with the California Education Code and Code of Regulations applicable to public school construction.\n\t \nThe construction of the facility will be administered and overseen by FMSD pursuant to a Development Agreement.  ESUHSD’s contribution will be paid by ESUHSD to FMSD to be applied strictly by FMSD to the construction of the facility, including ESUHSD’s classroom facilities, subject to record-keeping and accounting obligations by FMSD.  Once construction of the facility is complete, the overall facility will be leased by ECSV which will then, in turn, sublease a portion of the facility (5 classrooms and ancillary spaces) to ESUHSD for the District’s early childhood education career academy.  \n\t \nNegotiation of the Development Agreement, Sublease and other agreements are still underway and will be presented to the Board in the most current draft form at time of, or before, the Board meeting.  Presently, the term of the ESUHSD sublease for the facility is twenty-two (22) years; rent would be nominal (e.g., $1.00 per year).  ECSV would be contractually responsible for all operating and maintenance costs for the facility throughout the sublease term.\n\t \nPresently, and to take full advantage of available New Markets Tax Credit financing, the transaction group is targeting a transaction closing of early to mid-December 2013.  However, the next Regular Board meeting is December 12, 2013.  Therefore, to allow a pre-December 12 closing the Board would need to delegate the authority to Administration (Associate Superintendent of Business Services) to approve the Sublease and related agreements necessary to consummate this transaction, including but not limited to the Development Agreement, subject to later ratification by the Board.  Education Code section 17604 authorizes the Board, by a majority vote, to delegate to the District Superintendent or to any other persons that he or she may designate, or if there be no District Superintendent, then to any other officer or employee of the District that the Board may designate, authority to enter into contracts that may be limited as to time, money or subject matter or may be a blanket authorization in advance of its exercise, all as the Board may direct; provided, however, that “. . . no contract made pursuant to the delegation and authorization shall be valid or constitute an enforceable obligation against the District unless and until the same shall have been approved or ratified by the Governing Board, the approval or ratification to be evidenced by a motion of the Board duly passed and adopted.”\n\t \nThe Board is requested to delegate such authority to Associate Superintendent of Business Services Marcus Battle to negotiate and execute the final form of Sublease, Development Agreement and necessary related agreements, if any, consistent with the above general contractual parameters and subject to final ratification of such agreements by the Board at a subsequent Board meeting.\n\t \nFunding Source:\nMeasure I\n\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot to exceed $1,000,000 in Measure I funds; nominal lease payments (if any) to be paid from General Fund\n\t \nRecommendation:\nAdministration recommends that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No. 2013/2014-11 Delegating Authority to the Associate Superintendent of Business Services to Approve Final Form of Sublease, Development Agreement and Related Agreements for Early Childhood Education Program Facilities for ESUHSD Programs.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
