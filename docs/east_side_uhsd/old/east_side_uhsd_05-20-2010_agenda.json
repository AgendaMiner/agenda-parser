When the district became PI Year 2 (2005-06), they contracted with the Santa Clara County Office of Education as a provider. In 2006-07 the district selected The Nascent Group as their DAIT provider and has worked with Nascent from 2006 to 2010. During the past four years East Side developed, implemented, and monitored the LEA Addendum and Action Plan that addresses the needs of program improvement areas. Because a formal Report of Findings involving all stakeholders, using the four DAIT tools, (District Assistance Survey examining seven district areas and 39 standards was never administered) had not been done in the past, a full report to assess progress on implementation of the LEA Addendum Plan was scheduled. This report includes an extended needs assessment using the four recently revised (2009) DAIT tools, a set of findings, and recommendations which will be presented to the Board of Education on May 20. The recommendations are used to update the LEA Addendum and Action Plan. This report and update will go to the California Department of Education at the end of May.The following documents are attached:1.\tThe Report Of Findings2.\tPI Recommendations3.\tESUHSD APS Summary4.\tPI DAS Standards5.\tThe ELSSA –  English Learner Subgroup Self Assessment6.\tThe ISS - Inventory of Services and Supports (ISS) for Students with DisabilitiesFISCAL IMPACT:             NA  FUNDING SOURCE:         NA RECOMMENDATION:     It is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the above report.

C. Overfelt High School.  The project was Board awarded to Chevron.Prior to Phase I the District performed a contractor selection process that resulted in a recommendation that was presented and ultimately approved by the Board in October 2009; even though the Education Code 4217 does allow for districts to waive the solicitation process.  This technology has not changed significantly therefore, it is not warranted that the District spend additional resources to do another extensive solicitation process that would most like result in the same conclusion as we are recommending here.  There would be other things that would need to be heavily considered in our evaluation of other solutions that may be available in the market today.  The primarily consideration is that along with the six sites receiving a district-wide solar technology, educational curriculum was implemented for all high schools related to the installations.  This in itself would warrant a single source justification.  Other considerations are: (1) the continued installation suggests that the same or similar methodology that we just installed remains consistent in appearance and functionality of the solar panels; (2) the maintenance of the solar panels would need to be the same or similar so that maintenance can maintain the equipment on a consistent bases; (3) we would want the same or better savings with the same or better guarantee as Chevron has provided the District.Performance EvaluationOn February 1, 2010 Chevron began the installation of the Solar Photovoltaic Installation with the steel fabrication starting with Evergreen High School and completing with Independence High School.  The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 2010.Their performance during the installation was conducted in a professional and informative manner with extreme consideration of site students and staff.  As issues came up that may have affected the project in a negative way, Chevron’s Project Team kept the District informed at all times.  Most importantly they were able to handle these issues quickly and with minimal affect on the overall project.FISCAL IMPACT:$10,000,000FUNDING SOURCE:School Facilities Fund 35RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the continuance of the contract with Chevron for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic at James Lick High School, Mt. Pleasant High School, Oak Grove High School, Piedmont Hills High School, Silver Creek High School, and Yerba Buena High School, Independence Adult Education Center and Adopt Resolution #2009/2010-46 authorizing a lease agreement for the purpose of financing the Chevron Energy Solutions Company project.

The first funds for Measure E were sold in May of 2008. The Board of Trustees approved an initial Measure E Bond Program Budget in February, 2009. Modifications to project scope and attendant budgets have been brought to the Board for consideration and approval in the ensuing period - including April 2009, June 2009, and October 2009.  A combination of these periodic adjustments and economic conditions have had an impact on the internal consistency of the overall Master Measure E Program Budget.Expansion of scope on the Mt. Pleasant Multi-purpose Building to include previously “on-deck” remodeling of classroom quads has enabled the District to leverage bond funds to qualify for $10 million in State Matching funds.  Aggressive schedule management has also enabled concurrent launch of over 30 projects, allowing the District to take full advantage of the exceptional bidding climate and create as many new jobs as possible in the regional market.  A status review of current projects will accompany consideration of this item.It is proposed that a Measure E Master Budget be periodically reconsidered as a means of sustaining an aggressive approach to the delivery of projects under the Measure E bond program, allowing the District to leverage Bond dollars to the maximum extent, while exercising best fiscal practices.The Facilities Bond Team will be present to answer questions from the Board of Trustees.FISCAL IMPACT:   $0 Million FUNDING SOURCE:Measure ERECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposed  Measure  E Bond Program Master Budget by Site, limited to Board Approved Scope.",

At the request of the student’s parent or guardian, a school principal must submit to the local school governing board a request for a waiver of the requirement to pass the part(s) of the CAHSEE on which a modification was used and the equivalent of a passing score was earned.  For the local board to waive the CAHSEE requirement, the principal must certify to the local board that the pupil has all of the following:1)\tAn individualized education program adopted pursuant to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a plan adopted pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires the accommodations or modifications to be provided to the pupil when taking the high school exit examination.2)\tSufficient high school level coursework either satisfactorily completed or in progress in a high school level curriculum sufficient to have attained the skills and knowledge otherwise needed to pass the high school exit examination.3)\tAn individual score report for the pupil showing that the pupil has received the equivalent of a passing score on the high school exit examination while using a modification that fundamentally alters what the high school exit examination measures as determined by the State Board of Education.The waivers were requested by the school site administration on behalf of the students’ parents.The recommended waivers meet the aforementioned criteria delineated in Education Code Section 60851: Student A\t   Student B \tStudent C \tStudent D \tStudent E \tStudent F\tStudent G \t   Student H\tStudent I\tStudent J\tStudent K\tStudent L\tStudent M\t   Student N \tStudent O\tStudent P\tStudent Q\tStudent R\tStudent S\t   Student T\tStudent U\tStudent V\tStudent W\tStudent X\tStudent Y\t   Student Z\tStudent A1\tStudent B1 \tStudent C1 \tStudent D1 \tStudent E1 \t   Student F1\tStudent G1 \tStudent H1\tStudent I1 \tStudent J1\tStudent K1\t   Student L1\tStudent M1\tStudent N1\tStudent O1\tStudent P1Student Q1\t   Student R1\tStudent S1\tStudent T1\tStudent U1\tStudent V1\tStudent W1\t   Student X1\tStudent Y1\tStudent Z1\tStudent A2\tStudent B2 \tStudent C2    \t   Student D2 \tStudent E2 \tStudent F2\tStudent G2 \tStudent H2\tStudent I2\t   Student J2\tStudent K2\tStudent L2\tStudent M2\tStudent N2\tStudent O2\t   Student P2\tStudent Q2 FISCAL IMPACT:NAFUNDING SOURCE:NARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended waivers.",

Another proposal was received 24-hours beyond the due date and was not opened or considered in the evaluation process.The evaluation process consisted of a team of 10 evaluators who represented a broad base of users of the system.  Each evaluator was requested to evaluate the proposer’s responses regarding their ability to meet our minimum product capabilities, pricing and past vendor relations with the District.  The evaluators used a rating scale established by the purchasing department and in conjunction with the requirements described in the Request for Proposals. Purchasing contacted the references and added those scores to the evaluator’s score.  As for the final component in the evaluation, the oral interviews, it was decided by the evaluation committee that enough information had been provided in the written proposals that they did not feel the oral presentations would provide them any additional information that would add to their evaluations.  In consideration of the committee’s recommendation and the need to get the system purchased and implemented as soon as possible, Administration decided to waive the oral presentations and evaluate each of the proposals using a total rating scale of 90% rather than 100%Below are the total scores for each of the proposers:Vendor NameScoringFollett Software Company76%COMPanion Corporation51%FISCAL IMPACT:$155,154 estimated total costs which includes software, maintenance, training, professional development, barcode labels, scanning equipment, and implementation cost thru 1st two years of operation.FUNDING SOURCE:Various categorical fundsRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended to the Board of Trustees award the above listed solicitation process to Follett as the lowest responsible bidder.
