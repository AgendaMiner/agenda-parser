The goal of the program is to ensure that all migrant students reach challenging academic standards and graduate with a high school diploma.The program has many components during the school year and summer including student counseling, credit recovery opportunities, tutoring, health screening, referral services and transportation (VTA bus pass) for students attending a campus outside of their attendance area.  Parents also play an important role in the design and monitoring of the program through their elected roles in the Parent Action Committee which hosts six district parent meetings focusing on topics selected by parents at-large, and the PAC’s professional development which includes participating in leadership training workshops and local and state conferences.",

After listening to students and parents and meeting with community groups such as the Black Kitchen Cabinet, Coalition for Concerned Citizens, Unity Care Group, Latino parents and School Site Council, we recognize the need to change the culture of the school from one of a deficit-based philosophy to one of empowerment and success.  Our goal is to create an inclusive learning environment through an ABC strategy:A. affirming identityB. building community C. cultivating leadershipOur belief is that students who feel valued and included will close the achievement gap, which is not noticeably diminishing through academics alone.  Please note that although our plan is a work in progress, our goal is concrete: Oak Grove will become the model of an equity program and the flagship for the District.",

Over the past two years efforts have been made to close the gap by providing opportunities for students to access curriculum and removing barriers to higher level courses. There is a significant achievement gap that exists between our Asian subgroup and the rest of our students; however, some progress has been made in our Hispanic and African American subgroups. We believe the success is attributed to a variety of school wide changes that required the staff to analyze student performance data and adjust practices to meet student needs. Our focus this year is to “build our own capacity” which simply means that we have the skills to make the necessary improvements and through professional development staff will learn how to: \tPerform peer observations\tIdentify student engagement \tUse data to guide instructional practicesThe academic dividends from this effort will be demonstrated by our students in a variety of meaningful ways. Our hope is that over the next several years the achievement gap will continue decrease and ALL students will have the ability to perform at their optimal level..",

The timing of submission of the Board-approved energy incentive applications ensured that the incentive rates for kilowatts per hour (kWh) of generating capacity once installed by the District would be greater for about half of our school sites.  However, to ensure the availability of the Incentives reserved by the deposit and applications, the District must comply with the California Solar Initiative guidelines, including but not limited to installation of qualifying projects.The Board has been provided a schedule on October 20th showing the rates of return per kWh and a schedule of project milestone deadlines.  During negotiations with CES the scope of the project for the first phase was scaled down to address only the higher rate application sites and only the solar panel installation portion of the projects, all of which will generate a combined 3.7 megawatts of electrical output.  The six school sites identified for Phase 1 are:Andrew Hill High SchoolEvergreen Valley High SchoolFoothill High SchoolIndependence High SchoolSanta Teresa High SchoolW.C. Overfelt High SchoolTo preserve its deposit and the highest available rates for the above six school sites, the District submitted its Proof of Project Milestone packets to PG&E no later than October 22, 2009.  The required packet included a legally binding contract for the installation of a qualified project.  Acceptance of the packets and confirmation of the incentive rates has been received from PG&E.Potential Financial Impact to DistrictUnlike other California government agencies, public school districts’ ability to increase general revenues has been limited to parcel tax measures.  This project has the potential to improve revenue and at the same time decrease expenses for the District.  A solar/renewable energy installation project exchanges a monetary asset (money) for facilities/equipment assets (solar equipment) that upon completion and once in operation can decrease the demand on operational funds (for energy costs) while providing revenues (renewable energy credit) to the District.    Currently, and consistent with the Board’s directive to reduce financing costs and not use bond funds, we have developed a funding model that utilizes district capital funds and some financing.  The project as the Board has approved currently sized is at an amount not to exceed $24.1 million.  A funding model where the District contributes $15 million from Fund #35, with third party financing of $9.1 million.  The reasons for recommending this funding model is two fold.  The first reason takes into consideration the current State economy and the uncertainty of mid-year budget reductions and further deferral of State revenues.  In leaving a balance of approximately $10 million dollars in the Capital Facilities fund it would allow for temporarily borrowing of those funds for cash purposes and perhaps after the first of the calendar year an option to partially fund the second phase of the this project.  The second reason is that the rate of return on the funds invested is greater for this funding model.The District made requests for proposals to five financing organizations with three firms responding.  The firms that responded were: Blaylock Robert Van, LLC; First Security Leasing; and Banc of America Public Capital Corporation.  Interest rates for all three were comparable with Banc of America PCC locked at what is in the attached resolution.  A significant factor in selecting Banc of America PCC is that there was no term limit for early payback of the financing.  The other two firms restricted payback to six and ten year terms.FISCAL IMPACT:Financing of $9.1 millionFUNDING SOURCE:Funded debt retirement by energy cost savings over 15 yearsRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that after discussion the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2009/2010-16 which will provide financing for the solar panels at the six school sites in a total amount not to exceed $9.1 million.  Such project will produce an aggregate 3.7 megawatts of electrical output.          ",

This project is scheduled and approved under the Measure E projects.  Although the District has fund balances in Fund #23 (Measure E) from the $50 million sale of bonds in May 2008 we also have approximately over 30 projects in design.  Ordinarily we would be approaching the Municipal Bond Market for another bond sale series for which we have capacity given the District’s assessed valuation.  However, without a reasonable budget plan currently in place for the subsequent two fiscal years we most likely would not receive a favorable rating from the rating agencies.  That would result in a higher cost to the District and tax payers for the sale of such bonds.  We will have a budget plan in place for the First Interim Financial Report which is due December 15, 2009.After the Board awarded the contract to AMS.NET, Inc. there were discussions with CISCO Systems about implementation and starting the project given the aforementioned circumstances.  In an effort to assist the school district this financing was structured around CISCO Systems offering a financial promotion that would discount the interest on the financing by $85,860 over the three term of the lease purchase agreement if not paid off earlier.  There is the option of paying off the financing prior to February 22, 2010 without interest expense.  The financing through Key Government Finance, Inc. is structured with an interest rate of 3.82% however taking into consideration of the $85,860 financing promotion By CISCO the full financing term is 3.2%.The capital improvement part of the project costs and the financing schedule are as follows: (see attachment)The District’s intention is that after the First Interim Financial Report and the Governor’s Proposed Budget in January to go to the Municipal Bond Market and sell a new series of bonds for this and other progressing projects.FISCAL IMPACT:$990,742.18FUNDING SOURCE:Measure ERECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2009/2010-17 and approve the tax exempt lease/purchase agreement with Key Government Finance, Inc. with an interest rate not to exceed 3.82%.",

Reason for the Purchase of Outside Services.Due to the specialized educational services required to appropriately serve students who present with severe, unique emotional and/or developmental disabilities including mental retardation, autistic spectrum disorder, mood, disruptive behavior, anxiety and psychotic disorders residing in the ESUHSD, AchieveKids is a Non-Public School (NPS) offering such services that meet the widely, varying needs of this unique group of students.Selection Process There was no competitive solicitation done for this type of service.There is a determination made by the IEP team that ESUHSD is not currently able to meet particular students’ educational needs.  Recommendations are then presented at the students’ IEP meeting.  Referrals to AchieveKids were made at the students’ IEP meeting by a District Program Specialist after consultation with the District’s Special Services Coordinator.  AchieveKids is a NPS that offers specialized educational services for this unique group of ESUHSD students.
