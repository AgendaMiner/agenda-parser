East Side Union High School District students in grades 9-11 took the State mandated California Standards Tests (CST) and the California High School Exit Exam.  Together these assessments make up the elements of the Accountability Reporting System:  Academic Performance Index (API), Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), and Program Improvement (PI).\tStudents in grades 9-11 took tests in reading, mathematics, English language arts, science, and social science. \tStudents in grades 10 took the CAHSEE for the first time. Students who did not pass the CAHSEE previously also had additional testing opportunities. The following is a list of highlights:\tCalifornia Standards Testso\tGrades 9 and 11 demonstrated significant increases in proficiency in English Language Arts.o\tThere was a 5% increase in 10th grade Algebra 1 compared to 4 years of no improvement. This change comes after Program Improvement support classes were implemented in the 10th grade. o\tESUHSD continues to have an increase in the number of 9th grade students taking Biology and had over 200 more 9th graders take Physics. There continues to be a growth in the number of students taking Chemistry.o\tSocial Science showed significant gains in the percent of students scoring proficient.o\tA significant achievement gap still persists between Asian and African American and Hispanic students, as well as a gap due to language proficiency, socio economics, and disability.\tCalifornia High School Exit Examo\tESUHSD showed a 3% gain over the last year in Mathematics in the % of students passing the CAHSEE on their first attempt. o\tAll subgroups except SED, Hispanic, EL and SPED met their AMO targets for percent proficient. \tThe district is in Program Improvement Year-3 as a result of not meeting AYP in the area of proficiency levels.FISCAL IMPACT:N/AFUNDING SOURCE:N/ARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the above report.",

On February 19, 2009, the Board approved the payment by the District of deposits of up to $200,000 (not to be paid out of Measure E) and the filing applications for Energy Incentives with the Pacific, Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).  In June, the Board directed Administration to engage in negotiations with Chevron Energy Solutions for a solar services agreement for the design and building of a District solar installation project.  CES was selected after a District team went through a process, in the Spring of this year, to identify and review a number of companies/teams with expertise in the area of solar power energy programs.  CES had originally issued a preliminary estimate of approximately $70,000,000 for the installation of a comprehensive solar energy program at all District sites.Following the June Board meeting, the Administration has focused on narrowing and/or phasing the scope of the overall project to limit the District’s overall costs for the project.The timing of submission of the Board-approved Energy Incentive applications ensured that the incentive rates for kilowatts per hour (kWh) of generating capacity once installed by the District would be greater for about half of our school sites.  However, to ensure the availability of the Incentives reserved by the deposit and applications, the District must comply with the California Solar Initiative guidelines, including but not limited to installation of qualifying projects.Attached is a schedule showing the rates of return per kWh and a schedule of project milestone deadlines.  During negotiations with CES the scope of the project for the first phase has been scaled down to address only the higher rate application sites and only the solar panel installation portion of the projects, all of which would generate a combined 3.7 megawatts of electrical output.  The six school sites identified for Phase 1 are:Andrew Hill High SchoolEvergreen Valley High SchoolFoothill High SchoolIndependence High SchoolSanta Teresa High SchoolW.C. Overfelt High SchoolTo preserve its deposit and the highest available rates for the above six school sites, the District must submit its Proof of Project Milestone packets to PG&E no later than October 22, 2009.  The required packet must include a legally binding contract for the installation of a qualified project (if the District is to be the owner of the solar power equipment) or, in the alternative, an executed Power Purchase Agreement if the system is to be owned by a third party.  Potential Financial Impact to DistrictUnlike other California government agencies, public school districts’ ability to increase general revenues has been limited to parcel tax measures.  This project has the potential to improve revenue and at the same time decrease expenses for the District.  A solar/renewable energy installation project exchanges a monetary asset (money) for facilities/equipment assets (solar equipment) that upon completion and once in operation can decrease the demand on operational funds (for energy costs) while providing revenues (renewable energy credit) to the District.    Currently, and consistent with the Board’s directive to reduce financing costs and not use bond funds, we have narrowed the funding models down to three alternatives.  The project as currently sized is an estimated $24.1 million.  Under the first funding model (#1) the District would contribute $22 million from the Capital Facilities Fund #35 and third party financing at $2.1 million.  Under the second funding model (#2) the District would contribute $15 million from Fund #35, with third party financing of $9.1 million.  The third model (#3) would be for the District not to contribute any funds and finance the project through a Power Purchase Agreement that would establish a given rate for electrical cost and provide no incentive funding to the District.  Attached is a schedule that outlines the funding models and estimated savings/incentives that would benefit the District’s General Fund.FISCAL IMPACT:(1) $24,100,000 as cost of installation (plus financing costs, if any)(2) Estimated approx. +$2,400,000 annually to General Fund for years 1 -5, under Funding Model #1; $1,700,000 annually to General Fund under Funding model #2, and $115,000 annually to General Fund under a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)FUNDING SOURCE:Capital Facilities Fund #35 + financing alternative to be identifiedRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that after discussion the Board approve a funding model and direct the administration to finalize an agreement for the design/build solar installation project for the District, to include the six school sites as identified above and in a total amount not to exceed $24.1 million.  Such project will produce in aggregate 3.7 megawatts of electrical output.          \t Before entering into any agreement, the District will be required to hold a public hearing (with no less than two weeks’ notice) to determine whether any such contract is in the best interests of the District and whether the contract meets the requirements for such contracts as specified in Government Code section 4217.12.\n",

QSCBs are an interest-free financing vehicle for the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation or repair of K-12 school facilities.  The Stimulus Bill authorizes the nation-wide issuance of $11 billion of QSCBs in 2009 and an additional $11 billion in 2010.The ESUHSD has submitted an application to the State for QSCB and is second in line to receive an authorization to proceed with identified projects if other agencies withdraw their applications.  It is highly likely that ESUHSD will be approved to participate.  This Series B Bond sale will only be made upon approval by the State for ESUHSD to utilize QSCB.  The advantage of these bonds are that there is no interest charged to the District for the use of the funds thus saving District taxpayers significant tax dollars.FISCAL IMPACT:N/AFUNDING SOURCE:N/ARECOMMENDATION:It is recommended the Board of Trustees approve and adopt Resolution #2009/2010-12 Providing for the Issuance and Sale of General Obligation Bonds, 2008 Election, Series B, in the Aggregate Principal Amount of not to exceed $25,000,000 in Connection with Qualified School Construction Bond (QSCB) ",

Pleasant High School On June 18, 2009, the Board approved a revised Project Summary Worksheet for Mt. Pleasant High School that would allow for the modernization of all classrooms and the construction of a new multi-purpose building.On September 10, 2009, the Facilities bond team, along with the architect and construction management firms, met with the school administration and school site council representatives to discuss the specific scope and details of the modernization and new construction work.  The discussion led to the findings that even if the project moved forward, it will still not meet the needs of the school in totality as far as facilities issues are concerned.Specifically, the current plan would only allow for modernization of existing classrooms which will not address the issue of equity and parity in terms of classroom sizes and the general safety conditions at the school.  The existing plan will not have any provision for future classrooms and growth considering that the existing portable classrooms located on Marten Avenue side will meet its projected life cycle and will need to be removed in the near future.   Since the school qualifies for the State Modernization Grant Funds, the district intends to apply and capture approximately 10.3 million dollars because of the age and condition of the classrooms at Mt. Pleasant High School.The administration is recommending that the Board of Trustees consider allowing Mt. Pleasant High School the use of the modernization dollars in order to address the four (4) high priority items as developed by the school administration and school site council.  Allowing the school to retain and use the modernization dollars will help achieve the following critical needs of the school:1.\tAchieve a level of modernization and reconfiguration that will allow for equity and parity in terms of classroom sizes.  Currently, there are classrooms that are significantly smaller (720 square feet) compared to other classrooms within the school.  With the state classroom standard size of 960 square feet, the modernization funds will help expand the classrooms to an average size of close to the state classroom standard (940-960 square feet).  This will allow additional space to accommodate increased class size.2.\tThe existing configuration of the buildings lends itself to unsafe conditions as there are spaces that are hard for administration and staff to supervise.  A reconfiguration will occur under the new plan, if approved, that will remove the unsafe condition and will allow for better and effective student visual supervision.3.\tWith the portable classrooms located along Marten Avenue nearing its useful life cycle,  the infusion of modernization dollars will allow for the creation of 10 additional permanent classrooms at the school (6 classrooms from the modernization reconfiguration and 4 classrooms as part of the multi-purpose building) to provide continued housing for students.4.\tThe infusion of additional funds will also address the safety issue that currently exists in the football field. There has been an ongoing request from the Mt. Pleasant High School community to upgrade the football field and install synthetic turf to eliminate the deteriorating condition of the field which has led to leg injuries it the past.  Since the state modernization funding will be released to the district after application and approval, it is recommended that the funding be advanced from the board’s contingency funds and as soon as the funds are released by the state, the same amount will be put back into the board’s contingency funds.After extensive discussions with the school administration and school site council, this is a plan that all stakeholders in the Mt. Pleasant High School community strongly support as it will meet the long term needs of Mt. Pleasant High School and it will also equip the school to provide conducive learning environment by the increased size of the classrooms.Facilities bond team will be present to make a presentation and/or answer questions from the Board of Trustees. FISCAL IMPACT:                              $10.3 millionFUNDING SOURCE:State Modernization Grant FundsRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the above recommendations as the new plan for Mt. Pleasant High School and use of the Mt. Pleasant High School modernization grant funds for its campus projects.  Furthermore, it is recommended that the necessary funds be advanced from the Board’s contingency funds until the district receives the state’s modernization funds.  ",

During construction, Requests for Information (RFI's) are often necessary for clarification of design intent or specifications.  In several instances, these questions often result in construction delays. Even more costly are Change Orders which becomes a reality when drawings and specifications are not properly coordinated. In essence, the constructability review process helps to avoid or mitigate unnecessary costs and/or delays.  Well coordinated documents represent lower risk factors to both the district and potential contractors which can result in more competitive and reasonable bids.On March 10, 2009, the Board of Trustees approved Blach Construction Company and Facilities Management Planning and Operations, Inc. as construction management firms for the district’s capital facilities projects after going through a Request for Qualifications process.  Both firms provide 3rd party constructability review services and are recommended for this engagement.Fees for constructability review services will not exceed $350.00 per sheet reviewed.  The total cost for services of all projects under this recommendation will not exceed $200,000 for each firm.Environmental Consulting ServicesThe Bond Measure projects require environmental consulting services that include testing, monitoring, and construction abatement specifications for asbestos, lead and other possible environmental hazards.SGI secured written proposals from three (3) Environmental Consultants and the Facilities Division reviewed each proposal carefully.  ERT, Inc. was deemed to be the best proposal, not only because they have the lowest fees, but they have also provided consistent and exemplary service on previous projects with the district.  Moving forward with ERT, Inc. will assist the project architects to ensure that the current design efforts continue.  The total proposed cost for ERT, Inc. services will not exceed $200,000.  FUNDING SOURCE:Bond Measures G and E FundsRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Blach Construction   Inc. and Facilities Management Planning and Operations, Inc. to provide constructability review services and ERT, Inc. to provide environmental consulting services until the established engagement allocation as described above has been expended or the projects are completed.
