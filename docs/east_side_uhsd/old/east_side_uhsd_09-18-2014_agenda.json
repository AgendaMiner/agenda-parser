Each series was sold with optional call provisions, allowing the bonds to be refunded should interest rates decline in the future.  The first five series have previously been refunded, providing a reduction in debt service of $14,537,637.73.  On April 17, 2014, the Board approved Resolution #2013/14-22, authorizing the issuance and sale of the 2014 General Obligation Refunding Bonds of the District for the purpose of refunding the sixth series of general obligation bonds, consisting of the Series F Bonds.  The Series F Bonds were originally issued in 2006 and are subject to redemption on August 1, 2014.  The General Obligation Refunding Bonds were successfully sold via a limited competitive bid on June 4, 2014, and provided a reduction in debt service of $7,561,803.31, bringing the total taxpayer savings from issuing refunding bonds under Measure G to $22,099,441.04.    \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThe Refunding Bonds are payable from ad valorem property taxes levied on taxpayers in the District.  Under California law, the Refunding Bonds can only be issued if there are debt service savings, which result from the refunding, so the taxpayers are assured that property taxes will be reduced as a result of the refunding.  The sale of the 2014 General Obligation Refunding Bonds resulted in a total savings of $7,561,803.31 to taxpayers.\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nThe Refunding Bonds are payable from ad valorem property taxes levied on taxpayers in the District.  Neither the general fund nor any other funds of the District are pledged to the payment of debt service on the Refunding Bonds.\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nNot Applicable\n\t \n",

(McCarthy), to be the Lease Leaseback developer for the IHS Performing Art Center Bldg. F (Item 15.3, Attachment A).\n\t\t\t \nUpon approval of the Preconstruction Agreement, McCarthy immediately commenced implementing components of their Agreement including reviewing the Project Plans and Specifications prepared by Cody Anderson Architects (CAW) for constructability issues, technical review, value engineering, and obtained pricing from subcontractors and suppliers to generate a guaranteed maximum price (GMP).\n\t\t\t \nAs part of the thorough constructability and technical review of the plans and specifications, McCarthy provided information for potential conflicts in the plans and specifications that could lead to requests for information and potential change orders during the course of construction.  Van Pelt Construction Services (VPCS), the District’s Construction Manager, coordinated multiple meetings with McCarthy and CAW to review and address McCarty’s comments. CAW incorporated relevant comments into the final backcheck set of plans and specifications and are approved by Division of the State Architect (DSA).\n\t\t\t \nDuring the review of the plans and specifications, McCarthy identified multiple value engineering or values assessment (VA) options to address insure project costs remain within project budget. Each of these options were evaluated by the District’s Facilities staff, VPCS and CAW.  McCarthy incorporated the accepted VA options in the recommended GMP. \n\t\t\t \nAfter commencement of construction, McCarthy may present additional VA options.  If these VA options are accepted by the District’s Facilities staff, these savings will be added to Contractor’s Contingency.\n\t\t\t \nTo develop the final GMP, McCarthy divided the plans and specifications to thirty-eight work categories (WC) or subcontractor trade areas.  McCarthy solicited multiple subcontractors to provide bids for each WC, including subcontractors from the District’s approved list of subcontractors.  McCarthy interviewed the two lowest bid subcontractors for each WC to insure that their bids contained the full scope and met the experience and qualification criteria required by the contract documents.  VPCS attended several of these subcontractor interview sessions.  McCarthy provided the entire subcontractor pricing data used to prepare the final GMP.\n\t\t\t \nAdditionally in developing the final GMP, McCarthy prepared a detail list of assumptions and clarifications.  Each of these assumptions and clarifications were reviewed and accepted by the District’s Facilities staff, CAW and VPCS.  \n\t\t\t \nThrough this process of reviewing of the plans and specification for constructability and technical review issues, generating VA options and preparing the list of assumptions and clarifications, McCarthy developed their list of Owner contingency items.  This list was reviewed and edited by the District’s Facilities staff, VPCS and CAW.  As agreed by McCarthy, the Owner’s Contingency can only be used for a limited list of unforeseen conditions. McCarthy’s accepts the majority of design risk and unforeseen conditions associated with design conflicts.  McCarthy’s final GMP reflects this acceptance of risk.\nFiscal Impact:\nMeasure E: $8,610,000\nMeasure I: $851,006\nNot to Exceed the Total of: $9,461,006.00\n\t\t\t \nFunding Source:\nGeneral Obligation Bond Measures E and I\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees award a Lease Leaseback Site and Facilities Lease Agreements with McCarthy Building Companies, Inc., for Independence High School Performing Arts Center – Building F Lease Leaseback project in an amount not to exceed $9,461,006.00.\n\t\t\t \n\t \n",
