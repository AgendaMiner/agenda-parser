The data surrounding the site and learners like those of James Lick, demand that we focus our efforts on middle to high school transition on skill development inasmuch as we effectively provide a context and purpose for high school study that extends beyond these four years.

Pleasant High School PresentationThe mission of Mt. Pleasant High School is to provide an academically challenging, supportive, and safe environment in which each student is encouraged to be personally and socially responsible, self-motivated and a life-long learner.  The MP team joins parents and community to prepare the students to be productive adults. Teachers are at the core of our school’s mission. One of the major school restructuring efforts in the last few years has been the institutionalization of a 30 minute Advisory/Study Hall period. For the last 4 years, the staff at Mt. Pleasant High School has studied student achievement data, attendance trends and the affective needs of our student population. From this self-study, teachers created the Advisory model that the school followed for three years. Last year, after evaluating the Advisory model in place at the time, and discussing the challenges that the staff and students would face this school year, the staff voted to restructure Advisory into a 30 minute Study Hall. Today’s presentation will focus on the impact this new Study Hall model will have on the student’s academic achievement, the alignment of the Study Hall goals with our WASC and Single School Plan goals, and the opportunities for teacher leadership that this self-study process has created.

The purchase includes adding additional wheelchair capacity to the busses that will allow for variable seating that can go from a minimum of 24 ambulatory/1 wheelchair to up to 6 wheelchairs with approximately 6 ambulatory depending on rail placement. This is accomplished by adding additional wheelchair track stations and adding ambulatory track seats for easy change out based on the wheelchair needs. These busses include front and rear air conditioning for medically fragile students.Reason for the Purchase:Current special needs fleet is inadequate for the number of students needing transportation.   The need for wheelchair capacity has grown this school year with projections showing continued growth in wheelchair students needing transportation. Last year we serviced 47 wheelchair students. This year we currently have Bus Service Requests for 68, with the strong likelihood that the number will grow. We have current capacity for 51 wheelchair students. Contracting out services is expensive.  Scores of students have been transported in past years using contractors, resulting in costs of approximately $750,000 each year. By transporting the students in house the District will save a significant amount of money over our current practice of contracting out and most likely needing to expand those contracted out services.  For example, contracted out transportation for 15 Spectrum Center students cost $265,000 last fiscal year. Without these busses, contracting costs will substantially increase as the District will be forced to use the more expensive option to transport these students.Reducing ride times.  The District’s goal of reducing special need student ride times from approximately 1 hour 45 minutes each way to one hour or less has resulted in an increased need for additional busses and drivers. Current ride times under this new policy have been substantially reduced to well under one hour for most students.Selection Process “Piggyback”:These busses are being purchased using a “piggy-back” bid from Hemet Unified School District.  Hemet’s Bid Number 2009/10-0720 closed on August 6, 2009 and was awarded to Bus West on August 18, 2009 by the Hemet Unified School District Governing Board. The price per Thomas Built Saf-T-Liner C2 191TS school bus is $77,428 including tax. Selection Process “Lease/Purchase Finance Company”:Once the busses were selected, Staff then sought to obtain three (3) financing quotes.  The following are the three (3) quote options:Option #1:\tWells Fargo\tTerm:\t\t\t\t5 years, annual payments\tResidual:\t\t\t$1\tAnnual Advance Payment\t$117,496.97\tAnnual arrears Payment:\tN/A\tRate:\t\t\t\t4.20%Option #2:\tKey Equipment Finance\tTerm:\t\t\t\t5 years, annual payments\tResidual:\t\t\t$0\tAnnual Advance Payment\t$117,821.32\tAnnual arrears Payment:\t$122,946.55\tRate:\t\t\t\t4.35%Option #3:\tDaimler Truck Finance\tTerm:\t\t\t\t5 years, annual payments\tResidual:\t\t\t$1\tAnnual Advance Payment\t$117,410.47\tAnnual arrears Payment:\t$122.294.74 Rate:\t\t\t\t4.16%Staff is recommending Option #3, as the most cost effective financing arrangement for the seven (7) school busses at the 5 annual advance payments in the amount of $117,410.47 concluding with $1 buyout.
