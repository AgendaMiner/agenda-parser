Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager, and Kenneth Kerch, AIA, SGI Bond Program Manager\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action of Facilities Planning and Associated Architectural Service Contracts at Independence High School\n\t \n\t \nIndependence High School (IHS) was originally master planned in 1969, and opened its doors to students in 1976.   In 2004, Perkins & Will developed an updated Facilities Master Plan for IHS.  With the passage of time since the 2004 Facilities Master Plan, the modernization plans made in 2008-09 for the Measure E bond program, voter approval of Measure I in November 2012, and the fire that burned the B Commons building in March of this year, facilities planning efforts have focused on aligning current and future facilities improvements with academic strategies and available funding.\n\t \nThese facilities planning guiding principles were employed to provide a framework by which options were considered:\nFlip the “front” of the campus to North Jackson Avenue on the east side of the site, which nearly everyone already treats as the front of the campus.  The North Jackson Avenue east side of the campus has a more direct vehicular approach from the neighboring community, expansive areas of existing parking, and three existing pedestrian/vehicular entries. \nCreate a stronger entrance experience on North Jackson Avenue.\nComplete the entire modernization scope of Performing Arts Center Building F (Phases 1 and 2).\nTake advantage of the March 3, 2013 fire at B Commons by designing this building to house a school program that will reinforce the reorientation of the campus toward North Jackson Avenue.\nReduce the expansive size of Independence High School by creating an external entity “buffer zone” on the west side of the campus (Educational Park Drive).  Many of the existing facilities on the west side of the campus are currently occupied by non-IHS entities (San Jose Public Library, Adult Education, Pegasus, KIPP, San Jose State University, County Office of Education), which have a stronger physical presence on the west side than Independence High School itself.  The creation of this buffer zone would result in a reduced physical footprint, creating a campus size in alignment with current and projected future enrollment.  This reduced size would facilitate a more intimate feeling school, improved security for IHS, and reinforce North Jackson Avenue as the “front” of the campus.\nImprove campus navigability through intuitive way finding measures, supplemented as needed by way finding signage.\nMake plans in alignment with currently available funding, but with consideration for additional future work as funding becomes available.\n\t \nRepresentatives from Facilities Planning, SGI Program Management, IHS administration and School Site Council, and Superintendent’s Council, along with architects and construction managers currently working on active projects, have met on numerous occasions in the past months to identify options, and consider them in the context of the guiding principles listed above.  The process began with a review of the project priority list developed in 2008 (Attachment A), supplemented with newly identified projects and reflective of projects that have already been completed; priorities were reconsidered, and a current project priority list includes work that can be implemented immediately as well as projects on a longer (and currently unfunded) planning horizon (Attachment B).\n\t \nIHS has a unique and timely opportunity to affect Measure E (Phase 2) projects that are currently in preconstruction or construction phases, and commence the next round of projects (funded by Measure E, Measure G site improvement, Measure I, and insurance claim monies) to immediately implement this updated facilities plan, as follows:\n\t \nConvert Building N to house Administration, School Health Clinic, Academic Tutoring Student Center / Cybercafé, Counseling Center, Parent Center:\n\t \nRelocation of Administration to Building N was a low priority on the 2008 IHS project priority list, but it has risen in priority now because of a timely opportunity.  Building N (together with Building G) have been designed to be modernized, and a construction contract was awarded in late June 2013.  In order to modernize Building N, the existing occupants were relocated to other facilities:  Physical Conditioning was relocated to Building M; World Languages was relocated to Building E; the Book Room was relocated to the Library Building B.  Those relocated programs are perfectly happy in those facilities, and the programs are housed adjacent to complimentary programs; the “temporary” housing is well-placed, and with some very minor upgrades those programs can remain permanently in those spaces.\n\t \nThis creates an opportunity to relocate the programs currently housed in Building H (on the west side of the campus, within the “buffer zone”) to Building N, and co-locate new academic support programs that are aligned with current educational delivery objectives.  Administration’s relocation to Building N would reinforce N. Jackson Avenue as the front of the campus, and remove this IHS program from the “buffer zone”.  \n\t \nTo do so would require making minor design revisions focused primarily on furniture solutions.  However, given the change of use, the Architect of Record Cody Anderson Wasney Architects (CAW) is required to make revisions to the drawings and submit these revisions to Division of the State Architect (DSA).  With the exception of providing toilet facilities for the staff, these modifications are minor in nature and will require minimal review by DSA. It is anticipated that DSA review will occur in a timely fashion that will have only a minor impact on the current construction schedule of the project.  As this does represent architectural work effort exceeding that which is currently under contract, it requires a change order to CAW’s current architectural services agreement for the modernization of Building N.\n\t \nB Commons/Building G\n\t \nThe March 2013 fire in B Commons provides an opportunity to rethink where the Art Department is located.  The Art Department can easily fit into the B Commons, and even allows for a gallery space to be added.  Relocating Art to the B Commons would further reinforce the migration of programs toward the Jackson side of the campus, and remove yet another IHS program from the “buffer zone”.  \n\t \nCAW’s current architectural services agreement for the modernization of Building G will be affected by this change, in that their construction administration services and associated fee can be removed from the contract via a deductive change order.  As CAW is intimately familiar with the Art Department’s program, they are uniquely suited to redesign the B Commons for Art; this would require a new architectural services agreement for the redesign of B Commons.\n\t \nBuilding F Performing Arts Center\n\t \nAs a result of funding constraints, the Performing Arts Center Building F is currently being designed to be constructed in two (2) phases:  the entire scope of work is being designed concurrently, but the work is indicated on the drawings as “Phase 1” or “Phase 2”.  If constructed in a single phase, a construction cost savings of $200,000 would be realized and one year would be shaved off the construction schedule.  As an added bonus, Building G (or part thereof) can be used as temporary housing and/or storage for Building F programs while Building F is under construction. No changes are required to the CAW architectural services agreement for modernization of the Building F.\n\t \nStreetscape Improvements for a strong entrance experience on North Jackson Avenue\n\t \nTo create a strong and intuitive entrance experience and further reinforce North Jackson Avenue as the front of the campus, a streetscape improvement project would include the installation of attractive, low maintenance and drought tolerant landscaping and the construction of hardscape that clearly reinforces a “place of arrival” to the campus, including new fencing, a new marquee, way finding signage, improved drop off/pick up zones, and parking lot asphalt repairs.  The scope and design intent of this work will be considered the initial implementation phase, with a goal of expanding this improved aesthetic and vernacular into the campus as funding becomes available in the future.\n\t \nInfrastructure\n\t \nInfrastructure condition studies are in process.  There is a high probability that a portion of the Board’s $32.5M of discretionary Measure I funding that was preliminarily earmarked for infrastructure upgrades will be allocated to IHS.  \n\t \nFunding available to support these project components is:\n\t \nMeasure E\n$16.0M\nMeasure G site improvements\n$  0.5M\nMeasure I – IHS allocation\n$  2.8M\nInsurance claim proceeds (Fund 67)\n$  1.5 – 3.0M\nMeasure I - Infrastructure\n$  3.5 – 5.0M\nTotal\n$24.3 – 25.8M\n\t \nPlanning includes not only what facilities improvements will occur, but also how they will be packaged and delivered.  By engaging a single architectural firm for IHS, that firm has the ability to have a broader and longer range perspective in campus facilities planning, coordination, sequencing, and design.  CAW has been a very good business partner on the projects in which they’ve been engaged (Buildings F, G and N), and their continued and enhanced participation will allow them to work at an even higher level of inspired problem solving.  This “one architect, one construction manager, one contractor” approach facilitates efficiency, effectiveness and coordination, and there is an associated reduction in soft costs. Similar to the architectural firm, we are planning to present a contract scope and fee augmentation for the construction manager to the Board in October.  We are also exploring a Lease/Lease Back (LLB) construction delivery approach to identify a single contractor to execute the work, and will present information to the Board in the coming months that will provide an opportunity for education and discussion about the LLB delivery method.\n\t \nIn summary, there is an immediate desire to take advantage of timely opportunities delineated in this report for capital construction work at IHS.  The critical timing is related to projects currently in design or construction, the fire in B Commons, and a strategic bundling of projects under one architectural firm’s oversight.  Independence High School’s Site Council and Administration, with concurrence from Superintendent’s Council and the Facilities Planning team support the following CAW contract changes, in order to execute implementation of the campus facilities plan:\nModify Cody Anderson Wasney Architects current architectural services contract for Buildings N and G, to make revisions to Building N for the program changes delineated above, to remove unnecessary construction administration scope related to Building G, and to add full architectural services related to streetscape and infrastructure improvements.\n\t \nOriginal Contract Amount \n$266,000.00\nChange Order #1 (Board approved 5/9/13)\n-$4,501.00\nContract Amount Prior to This Change Order\n$261,499.00\nChange Order #2\n$507,320.00\nRevised Contract Amount\n$768,819.00\n\t \nAward a new architectural services contract to Cody Anderson Wasney Architects for modernizing B Commons for Art. \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$881,443\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure E – IHS allocation $457,320\nMeasure G $50,000\nFund 67 $374,123\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Amendment No. 02 to Work Authorization No. 01 and Change Order No. 02 to Purchase Order #201162 to redesign building N and reduce scope on building G for the Independence High School Modernization of Buildings N and G (Project Nos.

Overfelt, Yerba Buena, and James Lick.  The Santa Clara County has certified that each of the four schools have met the “Sufficiency of Textbooks” requirement.  The certification for the schools that are not visited is done by the principal.  Each principal, from the non-visited schools submit a signed “Certification of Textbook Sufficiency”.  \n\t \n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nSenate Bill 6 (Williams)\nState Instructional Materials Allocation\nDistrict Instructional Materials Budget\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTo be determined\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution #2013/2014-04 as proposed.\n",

We have all read about issues of bullying causing students to take drastic measures to escape the pain. Unfortunately, many of these drastic measures have resulted in suicide and/or murder.  Bullying is also linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health and substance use.\n\t \nEast Side Union High School District is committed to each student’s success in learning within a caring, responsive, and safe environment that is free of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and bullying.  On June 21, 2012, Board Policy 5131 Students – Conduct was amended and Board Policy 5131.2 Students – Bullying was adopted to comply with updated legislation, Assembly Bill 9. Board Policy 5131.2 Students – Bullying includes information on prevention, intervention and the process for handling complaints of bullying and cyberbullying. These policies prohibit discrimination, intimidation, harassment and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Sections 422.55 and 220 of the Penal Code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.\n\t \nThe District has adopted a process for receiving and investigating complaints of this nature as well as including bullying prevention strategies in the comprehensive safety plans.  In addition, staff and administration have received professional development training related to student discipline and bullying.\n\t \nDistrict Initiatives:\nAll school administrators were provided with training materials on how to identify when bullying is taking place and ways to intervene.  The administrators then used these materials to provide training to all staff.\nSome schools have conducted school-wide lessons with students so that they understand how devastating bullying is and how they can prevent or intervene when bullying occurs.\nAn anonymous hotline for each school is available for students and/or parents to report bullying incidents.\nAdministrators and support staff received training from legal counsel, Dora J. Dome, regarding the latest procedures in due process and the new requirements under Assembly Bill 9..\nEducation Code and Board Policies continue to be updated to comply with legislation.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nFor information only.  \n",

The Common Core State Standards increase the rigor of what students are expected to do at each grade level and changed the content standards in grades K-11 mathematics. The first Common Core State Standards assessments will be given in grades 3 - 8, & 11 in the spring of 2015 in Math, ELA, and Literacy.
