Under its guidelines adult education agencies who can not generate $50,000 in grant funding may apply for funding under a consortium model.  The four partners in the consortium are Metropolitan Adult Education, Campbell Union High School District, Mountain View-Los Altos Adult Education, Santa Clara Adult Education, and Sunnyvale-Cupertino Adult Education.  With the assistance of our consortium members, the East Side Adult Education has served as the lead partner in this consortium and is charged with submitting the application, monitoring the progress toward goal achievement, and evaluating the Carl Perkins plan annually.Accomplishments:Utilizing information for Central Santa Clara County from the Employment Development Department, input from the five Adult Education Program Advisory Committees, and staff and student surveys, the CTE Consortium Advisory Committee identified two industry sectors and related career pathways addressed in this five year plan.  Perkins funds will be used to assist programs in Health and Science which will focus on Clinical Nursing, Medical Assistant, and Home Health Aide Assistant career pathways.  The second industry sector is Information Technology, which will focus on Administrative Assistant, Database Administrator, Support & Services Technician, Desktop Publishing, and Accounting career pathways.  The Adult Education Programs in the consortium offer a thriving program for the completion of a secondary education and English language development and providing career learning opportunities in health, medicine, and information technology that have numerous entry and advancements options will complement our programs.
