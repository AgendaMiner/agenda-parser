Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nJuan Cruz, Assistant Superintendent of Instructional Services\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Approve Use of Board Discretionary, Measure I Bond Funds for Educare Facility\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nOn November 6, 2012, the District voters passed Measure I authorizing the issuance of up to $120,000,000 in Proposition 39 general obligation bonds.  Administration is proposing that up to $1,000,000 in Board discretionary funds from Measure I be used towards the leasing of land from Franklin-McKinley School District for the construction of a portion of the Educare Silicon Valley (“ECSV”) facility thereon.\n\t\t\t \nThe proposed ECSV facility would not be located on District property.  It is proposed to be constructed and located on property owned by the Franklin McKinley School District (“FMSD”), but which lies within the jurisdiction of this District.\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure provided that expenditures from the bond would be in compliance with the requirements of Article XIIIA, Section 1(b)(3), which provides, in part, that bond funds be used for “for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities . . . .”\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure language provided that:\n\t\t\t \n“To upgrade computer/science labs; improve security/safety; repair, equip, and construct classrooms/facilities at Andrew Hill, Calero, Evergreen Valley, Foothill, Independence, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, Yerba Buena, Overfelt, and District adult, and alternative, and charter schools; and acquire property for new schools, shall East Side Union High School District issue $120,000,000 of bonds with interest rates below legal limits and no funds for administrator salaries or taken by the State?  (Emphasis added)\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure further included that “Bond proceeds may also be expended to acquire real property (or any interest in real property) for future educational and support facilities”.  The Bond Project List which was also a part of the ballot measure specifies that “Bond proceeds will be expended to modernize, replace, renovate, construct, acquire, equip, furnish and otherwise improve the facilities of the District located at the following locations:  . . . ESUHSD Child Care Centers.”  (Emphasis added.)\n\t\t\t \nAdministration proposes to use the Measure I funds (not to exceed $1,000,000) to ground lease for a fixed term a portion of the FMSD site for the construction of a portion of the ECSV facility which would house all or a portion of the Early Learning Career Academy and which would serve current and future District students.  The ground lease term would approximate the estimated useable life of the facility so constructed.  A ground lease is an interest in real property.  Pursuant to the Measure I ballot language, bond proceeds may be used to acquire any interest in real property and to construct educational and support facilities for the District’s programs, including but not limited to the District’s Child Care Centers.  \n\t\t\t \nIn connection with such a ground lease the District would enter into a construction agreement with ECSV for the Early Learning Career Academy facility portion and a separate joint use and/or operating agreement governing the use and operation of the facility (including, e.g., insurance issues, liability, etc.).\n\t\t\t \nBased on the above, Legal Counsel is of the opinion that the use of Measure I funds for this purpose as proposed within this transactional framework is consistent with Measure I and Proposition 39.\n\t\t\t \nIf the Board approves Administration’s recommendations to proceed with negotiations then agreements once memorialized in writing will be presented to the Board for final approval at a future Board meeting.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nMeasure I\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot to exceed $1,000,000\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAdministration recommends that the Board of Trustees authorize Administration and Legal Counsel to proceed with negotiations for a ground lease transaction at the planned ECSV site for the construction of a portion of the proposed ECSV facility on Franklin-McKinley School District property, and related agreements.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n",

By doing a single RFP will give the District the ability to procure using volume.  The District will also be able to replace copiers every 3-5 years with new equipment helping us to stay current with technology.  Another benefit is that vendors will be obligated to replace “bad” or “lemon” copiers with new copiers.\n  \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nEstimated Increase $40,000 annually \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nSite General Fund\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve administration to re-issues an RFP to replace much of the District's old owned copiers with new leased copiers, and maintenance agreements and to acquire the best value proposal to stay current with technology.   \n",

Administration is seeking Delegation of Authority to dispose of low valued items under $2,500 (i.e. desk, chairs, tables, printers, etc.) on an as needed basis.  Administration will provide the Board with a list and resolution of the items on a quarterly basis for ratification.\n\t\t \nHistorically, Administration takes lists of old furniture and/or equipment that are no longer of used by the District to the Board monthly or on an as needed basis. Once the list of items is approved, Administration then moves the items to a central location and begins the surplus removal process (donation, sale, or disposal). This process can take up to three months depending on when the board meeting is and when the list is submitted to purchasing.\n\t\t \nDue to very tight timelines with regards to our modernization projects and working with our school sites and construction managers these items must be moved very quickly.  Administration would be able to utilize contractors and other resources to have items marked for surplus taken care of while still at the site versus having the items moved two and three times.  We are also working out a system to have non-profit organizations come and pick up items directly from sites also so as to reduce the number of time items have to be moved. \n\t\t \nBy granting this delegation, it will allow Administration to quickly respond to the sites need to have old, unused furniture and/or equipment removed and disposed of in a quick efficient manner.  \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve authorization for the Superintendent and/or designee to dispose of surplus furniture and equipment as needed and to provide the Board of Trustees with a list and resolution of the items on a quarterly basis for ratification.
