(McCarthy) to be the Lease Leaseback Developer for the Independence High School Modernization of Building B and Campus Site Improvement Projects (Item 15.03).\n\t \nUpon approval of the Preconstruction Agreement, McCarthy immediately began implementing components of their Agreement including reviewing the project plans and specifications prepared by Cody Anderson Architects (CAW) for constructability, technical review, value engineering, and obtaining pricing from subcontractors and suppliers to generate a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).\n\t \nAs part of the thorough constructability and technical review of the plans and specifications, McCarthy provided information for potential conflicts in the plans and specifications that could lead to requests for information and potential change orders during the course of construction.  Van Pelt Construction Services (VPCS), the project’s Construction Manager, conducted multiple meetings with McCarthy and CAW to review and address McCarthy’s comments. CAW incorporated relevant comments into the final backcheck set of plans and specifications under review by Division of the State Architect (DSA).\n\t \nDuring the review of the plans and specifications, McCarthy identified multiple value engineering options to ensure project costs remain within budget. Facilities staff, VPCS and CAW evaluated the options.  CAW incorporated the accepted value engineering options into their final design, which is reflected in McCarthy’s Building B demolition and Campus Site Improvements GMP. \n\t \nThe plans and specifications for the Modernization of Building B are under review by DSA.  While these plans are under review, McCarthy can commence with the interior demolition of Building B in order to be ready for construction upon DSA approval of plans.  Staff plans to seek Board approval of an amendment to the Site and Facilities Lease Agreements at a future Board meeting, following DSA approval, to include the Building B reconstruction cost to the GMP.\n\t \nTo develop the GMP, McCarthy divided the plans and specifications into work categories (WC) or subcontractor trade areas.  McCarthy solicited multiple subcontractors to provide bids for each WC, including firms from the District’s prequalified list of contractors.  McCarthy interviewed the two lowest bid subcontractors for each WC to ensure that their bids contain the full scope and meet the experience and qualification criteria required by the contract documents. McCarthy provided their subcontractor pricing data used to prepare the GMP.\n\t \nAdditionally, in developing the GMP, McCarthy prepared a detailed list of assumptions and clarifications.  Each of these assumptions and clarifications were reviewed and accepted by Facilities staff, CAW and VPCS.  \n\t \nThrough this process of reviewing of the plans and specification for constructability and technical review issues, generating value engineering options and preparing the list of assumptions and clarifications, McCarthy developed their list of Owner contingency items.  This list was reviewed and edited by Facilities staff, VPCS and CAW.  As agreed by McCarthy, the Owner’s Contingency can only be used for a limited list of unforeseen conditions. McCarthy accepts the majority of design risk and unforeseen conditions associated with design conflicts.  McCarthy’s GMP reflects this acceptance of risk. \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nMeasure I - $920,330.00\nFund 67 -    $394,427.00\nNot to Exceed $1, 314,757.00\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Obligation Bond Measure I and Fund 67\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees award Site and Facilities Lease Agreements with McCarthy Building Companies, Inc., for the Interior Demolition of Building B (Project No. Z-065-601) and Campus Improvements (Project No. Z-065-602) Lease Leaseback Projects, in an amount not to exceed $1,314,757.00.\n",
