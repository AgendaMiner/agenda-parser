The District underwent a thorough RFP.  The development of the RFP began several months prior to the release of the RFP.  A diverse group of district employees lead by Information Technology previewed the latest products available and compared them to the District’s experience with the existing SIS.  The current SIS will no longer be supported as of 2010 thereby forcing the District to procure an alternative SIS.  Out of the review of the latest products, a very well defined Scope of Work Matrix was developed.The RFP was released on November 18, 2008 and closed on December 17, 2008.  The RFP was advertised in a local newspaper and was announced at an IT conference where most if not all of vendors who provide this type of software were present. The District received nine responsive and responsible proposals.  The first step in the evaluation process was to score each of the nine proposals submitted to the District.  The proposals were scored in accordance with the scoring matrix in the RFP.  Those vendors who received a score of 60% or higher of the possible 80% (the remaining 20% was reserved for the oral interviews/demonstrations) were asked to give a demonstration: five vendors received a score of 60% or higher.The second and final step in the evaluation process was to conduct the oral interviews/ demonstrations. A 10 member panel was assembled which consisted of representatives from counseling, teachers, professional development, administration, attendance accounting, and IT.  All five vendors were scored on their demonstrations.All of the scores were added together and the vendor who received the highest score of 87% is Infinite Campus.  The second highest score was 78%.FISCAL IMPACT $457,000.00 Initial Costs$214,000.00 Ongoing Annual CostsFUNDING SOURCEMeasure EGeneral FundRECOMMENDATIONSIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees award the Request for Proposals (RFP), RFP-01-08-09, for the Student Information System (SIS) and to Enter into a Five-Year contract with Infinite Campus. \n",

The Academic Master Plan initiative was designed to guide District policy and practice through the year 2015 by integrating programs, services, and facilities for 21st century student success.The three major areas of focus for the AMP included:Identification of specific programs and projects that would meet the needs of the 21st century studentIdentification of practices and programs to narrow the achievement gap and meet the requirement of Program ImprovementRecommendations on the utilization of Measure E fundsThe plan included the identification of an intersection between academic programs and renovated and newly constructed facilities, technology and equipment that provides the district with an innovative approach to equitably prioritizing resources.Specific criteria were developed by a team of stakeholders, including the Academic Master Plan working group, district facility staff, Superintendent and cabinet, School Site Council, and campus administrators.A Project Ranking & Pricing Process that is standardized, equitable and stakeholder driven was developed based on the Academic Master Plan categories of Health, Safety & ADA, Capacity, Technology, Outdoor / Athletic Spaces, Collaborative Spaces, and Specialty Spaces. The Academic Master Plan criteria used to establish standardized criteria for ranking projects was used. The criteria was based on consistency of request, reasonable and affordable, impact on the greatest number of students, timing of projects – long & short, addressing the achievement gap, parity and equity, and cost savings measures. Sources of District and campus needs were based on the Academic Master Plan, Technology Master Plan, Measure G Master Plan, Preliminary Needs Assessment, Maintenance & Operations Deferred Maintenance Plan, and School Site Council priorities.The Measure E Campus Priority project evaluation was based on the above process.Following project reviews with each of the comprehensive campuses, the campuses presented their priorities to the Board on February 7, 2009.The cabinet reviewed the campus list of projects and provided an adjusted order of priorities.FISCAL IMPACT:Campus Projects Total   $215,897,865.00District-Wide Technology  $27,460,000.00FUNDING SOURCE:Measure ERECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Measure E Prioritization List.

Such experience is beneficial in their work to effectively and efficiently lead public education and improve student achievement; andWHEREAS, Public schools operate with lean management systems. Across the nation, public schools employ fewer managers and supervisors than most public and private sector industries including transportation, food service, manufacturing, utilities, construction, publishing and public administration; andWHEREAS, School leaders depend on a network of support from school communities – fellow administrators, teachers, parents, students, businesses, community members, board trustees, colleges and universities, community and faith-based organizations, elected officials and district and county staff and resources – to promote ongoing student achievement and school success; andWHEREAS, Research shows great schools are led by great principals, and great districts are led by great superintendents.

Woodson; his aim was to encourage a greater awareness and understanding of the African experience and contributions in America, Africa and throughout the world; andWHEREAS, later, in the 1960’s, the week expanded into Black History Month to commemorate, through community activities, a more balanced and accurate picture of Black History, and is celebrated yearly during the entire month of February, as it coincides with the birthdays of the great African American Leader Frederick Douglass (February 15) and Abraham Lincoln (February 12); andWHEREAS, the East Side Union High School District recognizes the significant contributions and huge advances African Americans have made, and continue to make in our community, state and the world, in such areas as education, medicine, art, culture, public service, economic and development, politics and human rights; we see the greatness of America in those who have risen above injustice and enriched our society; andWHEREAS, the East Side Union High School District in its continued effort to honor African American History Month and to enhance equity and diversity, will seek to make changes in all its language to replace the word \"tolerance\" with words like \"acceptance, respect, inclusion and appreciation,\" whenever relating to equity and/or diversity;THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the East Side Union High School District hereby proclaims February 2009 as National African American History Month.

For the local board to waive the CAHSEE requirement, the principal must certify to the local board that the pupil has all of the following:1)\tAn individualized education program adopted pursuant to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a plan adopted pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires the accommodations or modifications to be provided to the pupil when taking the high school exit examination.2)\tSufficient high school level coursework either satisfactorily completed or in progress in a high school level curriculum sufficient to have attained the skills and knowledge otherwise needed to pass the high school exit examination.3)\tAn individual score report for the pupil showing that the pupil has received the equivalent of a passing score on the high school exit examination while using a modification that fundamentally alters what the high school exit examination measures as determined by the State Board of Education.The waivers were requested by the school site administration on behalf of the students’ parents.The recommended waivers meet the aforementioned criteria delineated in Education Code Section 60851: Student A\tStudent B\tStudent C\tStudent D\tStudent E\tStudent FStudent G\tStudent H\tStudent I\tStudent J\tStudent K\tStudent LStudent M\tStudent N\tStudent O\tStudent P\tStudent Q\tStudent RStudent S\tStudent T\tStudent U\tStudent V\tStudent W\tStudent XStudent Y\tStudent Z\tStudent A2\tStudent B2\tStudent C2\tStudent D2\tStudent E2\tStudent F2Student G2\tStudent H2\tStudent I2\tStudent J2\tStudent K2\tStudent L2Student M2\tStudent N2\tStudent O2\tStudent P2\tStudent Q2\tStudent R2Student S2\tStudent T2\tStudent U2\tStudent V2\tStudent W2\tStudent X2Student Y2\tStudent Z2\tStudent A3\tStudent B3\tStudent C3\tStudent D3\tStudent E3\tStudent F3\tStudent G3\tStudent H3\tStudent I3 FISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:NoneRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended waivers.
