Specifically, the District has learned that MACSA Academia Calmecac is substantially in arrears in STS/PERS contributions for its charter school employees.  The charter school is currently under investigation by the County Office of Education in connection with the charter school’s finances and the management of its fiscal affairs.The California Charter Schools Act of 1992 requires the authorizing agency of a charter school to monitor and oversee the charter and further provides that a charter may be revoked by the authorizing agency if it finds that the charter has, among other actions, committed a material violation of any of the conditions, standards or procedures set forth in its charter, failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles, engaged in fiscal mismanagement, and/or violated any provision of the law.  Education Code 47607(d) requires that prior to revocation, the charter granting agency notify the charter school of any violation of the foregoing and give the charter school a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violations(s), unless the authority determines, in writing that the violation(s) constitutes a severe and imminent threat to the health or safety of the pupils.  If the charter fails to remedy a violation within the period specified, the chartering agency may commence revocation of the charter in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the Education Code.FISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:NoneRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the Superintendent to issue a Notice To Remedy pursuant to Education Code 47607 to MACSA Academia Calmecac Charter School.",

Prior to that time, districts were required to issue individual statements of need for each applicant.  The applicant, in turn, would take the declaration of need to the county office of education for the issuance of an emergency credential. This applies to the following credentials or authorizations: Emergency CLAD, BCLAD, Resource Specialist, Library Media, Clinical or Rehabilitative Permits.Now, the Commission issues a permit to an individual who qualifies for an emergency based on the district’s Declaration of Need.  This Declaration, approved by the local Board of Trustees, is submitted to the Commission once a year.  Emergency permits, although originally used primarily to staff partial assignments and special education, now help fill the fully credentialed teacher gap created by class size reduction and statewide teacher shortage.  Every attempt is being made to hire credentialed teachers before considering people on emergency permits.  Attached is the Commission on Teacher Credentialing form titled Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.  Pursuant to direction from the county office of education’s credential’s office, the district is over estimating the number of permits it might require in order to cover any unanticipated needs that might occur during the course of the 2009-2010 school year.FISCAL IMPACT: As per salary scheduleFUNDING SOURCE: General, Special Education and Adult Education fundsRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators\n",
