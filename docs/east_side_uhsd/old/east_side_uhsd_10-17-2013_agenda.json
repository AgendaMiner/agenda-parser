We have all read about issues of bullying causing students to take drastic measures to escape the pain. Unfortunately, many of these drastic measures have resulted in suicide and/or murder.  Bullying is also linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health and substance use.\n\t\t \nEast Side Union High School District is committed to each student’s success in learning within a caring, responsive, and safe environment that is free of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and bullying.  On June 21, 2012, Board Policy 5131 Students – Conduct was amended and Board Policy 5131.2 Students – Bullying was adopted to comply with updated legislation, Assembly Bill 9. Board Policy 5131.2 Students – Bullying includes information on prevention, intervention and the process for handling complaints of bullying and cyberbullying. These policies prohibit discrimination, intimidation, harassment and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Sections 422.55 and 220 of the Penal Code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.\n\t\t \nThe District has adopted a process for receiving and investigating complaints of this nature as well as including bullying prevention strategies in the comprehensive safety plans.  In addition, staff and administration have received professional development training related to student discipline and bullying.\n\t\t \nDistrict Initiatives:\nAll school administrators were provided with training materials on how to identify when bullying is taking place and ways to intervene.  The administrators then used these materials to provide training to all staff.\nSome schools have conducted school-wide lessons with students so that they understand how devastating bullying is and how they can prevent or intervene when bullying occurs.\nAn anonymous hotline for each school is available for students and/or parents to report bullying incidents.\nAdministrators and support staff received training from legal counsel, Dora J. Dome, regarding the latest procedures in due process and the new requirements under Assembly Bill 9.\nAssociate Principals also received training from JoAnn Allen, Santa Cruz COE Safe Schools Coordinator, in bullying laws and changing the culture and climate in schools.\nEach school site will participate in the WeTip anonymous crime reporting hotline program that students can call to report crime or bullying incidents.  All calls are confidential.  Literature includes posters, brochures and cards related to bullying, graffiti and other crimes.\nThe attached presentation outlines school initiated efforts.\n\t\t \nEducation Code and Board Policies continue to be updated to comply with legislation.\n\t \n",
