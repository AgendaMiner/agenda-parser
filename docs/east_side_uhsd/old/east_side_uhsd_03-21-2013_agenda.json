Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nJuan Cruz, Assistant Superintendent of Instructional Services, and Kirsten King, Director of Instructional Services\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of Escuela Popular/Center for Training and Careers Charter Renewal Petition\n\t \nBACKGROUND\nPublic Charter Schools are approved initially up to a five (5) year period and at the end of that time must apply for a charter school renewal for a term of five (5) years and continue to apply for renewal after each five (5) year term.  The District received a renewal petition for Escuela Popular/Center for Training and Careers Careers at the January 17, 2013 Board Meeting.  Pursuant to Education Code 47605 a public hearing is required within thirty (30) days following the submission of a renewal charter school petition to the District.\n\t \nThe purpose of the Public Hearing is to allow the Governing Board of the school district an opportunity to consider the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents.  The public hearing was held during the February 14, 2013 board meeting where EPCTC gave a presentation and several community supporters and students spoke on behalf of the charter.  There were many additional supporters in attendance.\n\t \nThe Governing Board shall either grant or deny the charter renewal within sixty (60) days of the petition; however, the date may be extended by an additional 30 days if both parties agree to the extension.  Such agreement has been reached and at the March 21, 2013 Board Meeting the Governing Board shall make its determination.\n\t \nEscuela Popular/Center for Training and Careers is a charter school authorized by the East Side Union High School District with approximately 1,000 adult aged 18+ year old students.  Escuela Popular targets new immigrant Spanish speaking students 18 years and older who would like to earn a high school diploma, as well as gain technology skills.  This adult aged charter school works in conjunction with the Escuela Popular Accelerated Family Learning Center K-12 school to provide services to the whole family.  This includes a dual emersion K-12 school environment along with free child care for students' children.\n\t \nA team of District experts from the Instructional Division, Business Division, and Human Resources Division reviewed the charter renewal proposal and visited the school.  The age of the student population, the small number of 18-22 year olds, as well as the instructional model, make it challenging to find similar schools for data comparisons.  Their findings are included in the renewal matrix which measures the charters compliance to renewal education code 47607 as well as a sound educational program.\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees grant  a five (5) year renewal to Escuela Popular/Center for Training and Careers which will expire, June 30, 2018.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Approve Use of Board Discretionary, Measure I Bond Funds for Educare Facility\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nOn November 6, 2012, the District voters passed Measure I authorizing the issuance of up to $120,000,000 in Proposition 39 general obligation bonds.  Administration is proposing that up to $1,000,000 in Board discretionary funds from Measure I be used towards the leasing of land from Franklin-McKinley School District for the construction of a portion of the Educare Silicon Valley (“ECSV”) facility thereon.\n\t\t\t \nThe proposed ECSV facility would not be located on District property.  It is proposed to be constructed and located on property owned by the Franklin McKinley School District (“FMSD”), but which lies within the jurisdiction of this District.\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure provided that expenditures from the bond would be in compliance with the requirements of Article XIIIA, Section 1(b)(3), which provides, in part, that bond funds be used for “for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities . . . .”\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure language provided that:\n\t\t\t \n“To upgrade computer/science labs; improve security/safety; repair, equip, and construct classrooms/facilities at Andrew Hill, Calero, Evergreen Valley, Foothill, Independence, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, Yerba Buena, Overfelt, and District adult, and alternative, and charter schools; and acquire property for new schools, shall East Side Union High School District issue $120,000,000 of bonds with interest rates below legal limits and no funds for administrator salaries or taken by the State?  (Emphasis added)\n\t\t\t \nThe Measure I ballot measure further included that “Bond proceeds may also be expended to acquire real property (or any interest in real property) for future educational and support facilities”.  The Bond Project List which was also a part of the ballot measure specifies that “Bond proceeds will be expended to modernize, replace, renovate, construct, acquire, equip, furnish and otherwise improve the facilities of the District located at the following locations:  . . . ESUHSD Child Care Centers.”  (Emphasis added.)\n\t\t\t \nAdministration proposes to use the Measure I funds (not to exceed $1,000,000) to ground lease for a fixed term a portion of the FMSD site for the construction of a portion of the ECSV facility which would house all or a portion of the Early Learning Career Academy and which would serve current and future District students.  The ground lease term would approximate the estimated useable life of the facility so constructed.  A ground lease is an interest in real property.  Pursuant to the Measure I ballot language, bond proceeds may be used to acquire any interest in real property and to construct educational and support facilities for the District’s programs, including but not limited to the District’s Child Care Centers.  \n\t\t\t \nIn connection with such a ground lease the District would enter into a construction agreement with ECSV for the Early Learning Career Academy facility portion and a separate joint use and/or operating agreement governing the use and operation of the facility (including, e.g., insurance issues, liability, etc.).\n\t\t\t \nBased on the above, Legal Counsel is of the opinion that the use of Measure I funds for this purpose as proposed within this transactional framework is consistent with Measure I and Proposition 39.\n\t\t\t \nIf the Board approves Administration’s recommendations to proceed with negotiations then agreements once memorialized in writing will be presented to the Board for final approval at a future Board meeting.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nMeasure I\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot to exceed $1,000,000\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\n\t\t\t \nAdministration recommends that the Board of Trustees authorize Administration and Legal Counsel to proceed with negotiations for a ground lease transaction at the planned ECSV site for the construction of a portion of the proposed ECSV facility on Franklin-McKinley School District property, and related agreements.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities\nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Determine that Design-Build Delivery for Swimming Pool Modernization Project will Reduce Project Costs, Expedite the Project’s Completion, or Provide Features Not Achievable Through the Design-Bid-Build Process\n\t \nOn November 17, 2011, the Board of Trustees approved a site improvement/deferred maintenance plan, to be funded by Measure G bond proceeds.  That plan included swimming pool repairs at Independence, Yerba Buena, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, James Lick, Mt. Pleasant and W.C. Overfelt High Schools, budgeted at $5.23 million.  On December 11, 2012 the Board augmented the project budget by $10.5 million, funded by the Board’s discretionary Measure I bond funds, in order to improve outcomes by expanding aquatic program capacity, lowering operating costs, mitigating risks associated with limited scope repair projects, and increasing overall satisfaction.  On February 14, 2013, the Board considered public works construction project delivery methods available for this project, including design-bid-build, design-build, energy service contracting, and lease lease-back.  \n\t \nThe Independence pool is currently being modernized under a construction contract awarded by the Board on December 11, 2012, via the design-bid-build delivery method.  For the remaining seven pool sites, District staff has examined possible construction delivery methods and has concluded that the use of design-build delivery for the project offers the following potential advantages to the District not available under a traditional design-bid-build delivery method:\n\t \nSimplified contracting and contract administration:  There is one contract with the design-build entity instead of separate contracts with an architect and a contractor.   This reduces administrative burden and associated costs.\nCost containment:  The design-build entity is under a contract to complete the project meeting the District’s stated requirements within the contract price.\nCost savings:  Innovative, cost-effective solutions meeting performance criteria can be achieved by collaboration between the designer and builder, adding construction practicality to design imagination.  The builder is involved in the design process from the beginning and can provide helpful insights on construction materials and methods that can make the design more efficient and less costly to construct, operate and maintain. \nEarly cost definition:  Project costs are determined much sooner than with the traditional design-bid-build process.   The design-build method enables the District to determine the cost of the project upon award of the design-build contract instead of after Division of the State Architect approval and construction contract bidding.   This early cost knowledge allows the District to make informed decisions on detailed scope in order to ensure equity of outcomes among the school sites.\nReduced number of change orders and disputes:  Because the designer and builder are part of the same design-build entity, and the District is not the guarantor of the completeness and accuracy of the work of the architect/engineer, the District may avoid conflicts and disputes, and the corresponding costs of those conflicts and disputes that can arise between the architect/engineer and construction contractor.\nGreater risk shifting and more efficient risk allocation:  The vesting of design and construction functions under one entity enables proper allocation of risk under the design-build contract, because the contractor’s involvement in constructability review and existing site condition surveys during preconstruction activities reduces or eliminates the need for redesign during the construction phase. \nReduction in adversarial relationships:  The designer and builder are teamed together, working under a single contract.  This teaming can significantly reduce traditional conflicts and finger-pointing between designer and contractor, and eliminate the need for the District to referee disputes.\nTime savings:  The design-build entity is allowed the freedom to explore time-saving construction methods or systems while meeting the District’s stated criteria.  Early coordination between the designer and builder can help prevent construction delays.  Additionally, by overlapping design and construction to some extent, design-build can deliver the project faster than the design-bid-build approach.  Any and all of these elements can accelerate delivery of modernized swimming pools.\nAlternative selection process: Design-build entities may be selected on the basis of factors other than price alone.  Design-build entities can assemble a team of architects, engineers, subcontractors and suppliers with whom they have had previous successful collaborations, and that reflect the goals and needs of the project.  The District can select the winning team based on not only price, but also other factors including technical expertise, life cycle cost over 15 years or more, skilled labor force availability, safety record, successful previous experience, project-specific plans and schedules, design, and other qualitative elements.\n\t \nEducation Code §17250.20 stipulates that upon making a determination by the governing board that it is in the best interest of the District, the Board may enter into a design-build contract for both the design and construction of a school facility if that expenditure exceeds two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) if, after evaluation of the traditional design, bid, and build process of school construction and of the design-build process in a public meeting, the governing board makes written findings that use of the design-build process on the specific project under consideration will accomplish one of the following objectives:  reduce comparable project costs, expedite the project's completion, or provide features not achievable through the traditional design-bid-build method.  The governing board also shall review the guidelines developed pursuant to Education Code §17250.40 (Attachment A) and shall adopt a resolution approving the use of a design-build contract pursuant to this chapter prior to entering into a design-build contract.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot
