Pursuant to Education Code 47605 a public hearing is required within thirty (30) days following the submission of a renewal charter school petition to the district.  The renewal petition was submitted to the district on January 3, 2011.  When requested by the district, an extension of the thirty (30) day requirement for a public hearing may be granted by the petitioning charter school entity.  Such permission was granted by the petitioner, Latino College Preparatory Academy. \n\t \nDuring the Public Hearing the Governing Board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents.  The Governing Board shall either grant or deny the charter renewal within sixty (60) days of receipt of the petition; however, the date may be extended by an additional thirty (30) days if both parties agree to the extension.  Such agreement has been reached and at the March 24, 2011 Board Meeting the Governing Board shall make its determination.\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE: \nPart of Review Process\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nPart of Review Process\n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nHold Public Hearing to consider level of support for the petition renewal submitted by Latino College Preparatory Academy.\n",

Funding for the SDC students is provided through a daily allocation from the State Department.\n\t \nSummer School Sites:\nThe following school sites are being recommended as locations for summer school during the summer of 2011:\nAndrew Hill High School                \nIndependence High School           \nJames Lick High School\nMt.

Notice of the Resolution was published and posted as required by law. The Resolution and the published and posted Notice of Intention to Lease specified that the District would receive sealed proposals to lease from interested parties up to 5:00 p.m. on February 16, 2011. The Resolution further specified that the sealed proposals would be opened the next day at the time of the Board’s February 17 meeting.  Pursuant to Education Code sections 17472 and 17473, all sealed proposals received by the District in accordance with the Resolution and the Notice of Intention to Lease shall be opened, examined and declared by the Board in public session. Before accepting the sealed proposals, the Board shall call for oral bids upon the terms outlined in Section 17473.\nAt the time of the February 17, Board meeting, Administration will present to the Board all sealed proposals received by the District in accordance with the Resolution and the Notice of Intention to Lease.\nPursuant to Education Code section 17529, a school district may enter into a lease agreement for the joint use of operating school sites provided the Board first determines that the joint occupancy/use of such property will not: (1) interfere with the education program or activities of any school or class conducted upon the real property or in any building; (2) unduly disrupt the residents in the surrounding neighborhood; and (3) jeopardize the safety of the children of the school. At the September 17, 2009, Regular Board Meeting, the Board held a public hearing to solicit community input on the potential leasing of District property for such purposes. \nAt the time of the February 17 meeting, and per the earlier agenda item for the opening of sealed proposals, the Board will open all sealed proposals received by the District. Once opened, the proposals will be reviewed by staff and a recommendation made to the Board. Final acceptance of the Board may be made by majority vote at the time of the February 17 meeting (provided the Board first makes the determinations set forth in the preceding paragraph). Alternatively, the Board may reject any and all received bids (either written or oral) and withdraw the property from lease if it deems such action to be for the best public interest.

The other 6% of cell phone calls are attributed to personal use and, therefore, not allowable under E-Rate.\n\t \nThe current issue under review is the district’s bidding procedure to acquire internet access purchased from AT&T (SBC at the time) in October / November 2005.  Whenever an E-Rate eligible service is being considered for purchase, the bidding process must start with the posting a notice called Form 470.  On October 28, 2005, a Form 470 was posted and, thus, began a 28-day waiting period for bids to come in.   In this situation, no bids were received within the time frame allowed, which resulted in ESUHSD signing a contract with AT&T for internet access services on or about November 25, 2005.  \n\t \nDuring the Special Compliance review process, an issue developed where an E-Rate reviewer noted that, by our own admission, a competing bid from Qwest Communication, in 2005, may have not been considered properly.  E-Rate regulations are clear in that when two or more bids are received, an evaluation must take place with the award winner being the most cost effective bid.   The district explained the discrepancy by noting that the Qwest bid arrived late and, therefore, not eligible for consideration.   \n\t \nThe explanation was provided to the Special Compliance Review Unit, along with the Quest bid documentation.  In response, the Special Compliance Review Unit has requested a copy of the AT&T contract. The district has been granted an extension until February 17, 2011, to provide adequate documentation regarding its claims.\n",
