This applies to the following credentials or authorizations: Emergency CLAD, BCLAD, Resource Specialist, Library Media, Clinical or Rehabilitative Permits.\n\t \nNow, the Commission issues a permit to an individual who qualifies for an emergency based on the district’s Declaration of Need.  This Declaration, approved by the local Board of Trustees, is submitted to the Commission once a year.  \n\t \nEmergency permits, although originally used primarily to staff partial assignments and special education, now help fill the fully credentialed teacher gap created by class size reduction and statewide teacher shortage.  Every attempt is being made to hire credentialed teachers before considering people on emergency permits.  \n\t \nAttached is the Commission on Teacher Credentialing form titled Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.  Pursuant to direction from the county office of education’s credential’s office, the district is over estimating the number of permits it might require in order to cover any unanticipated needs that might occur during the course of the 2012-2013 school year.\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nAs per salary schedule\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nGeneral, Special Education and Adult Education funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators.\n",
