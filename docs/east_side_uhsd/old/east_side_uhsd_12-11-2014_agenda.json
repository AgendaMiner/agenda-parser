Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nJuan Cruz, Associate Superintendent of Educational Services, Kirsten King, Director of Instructional Services and Lucretia Peebles, Ph.D., Administrator for Charter School Oversight\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of the East Side Union High School District's Request to Amend the Term of the Luis Valdez Leadership Academy Charter (aka Latino College Preparatory Academy II)\n\t\t \n1.  Brief Introduction and Summary of Recommendation\n\t\t \nOn August 22, 2013, the East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) conditionally approved the charter petition for Latino College Preparatory Academy II (aka Luis Valdez Leadership Academy), granting the NHU Foundation permission to operate the Luis Valdez Leadership Academy (LVLA) within the boundaries of the East Side Union High School District, located in San Jose, California, for a term of two years, beginning on August 22, 2013, and ending on June 30, 2015. LVLA opened on the Yerba Buena High School campus on August 11, 2014, offering only the ninth grade. The school will add a grade each year to reach its full complement of grades (9-12) and enrollment capacity of 400 students. The current enrollment at LVLA is 93 students.\n\t\t \nThe Board conditionally approved the charter petition for LVLA based on the District Administration’s concerns regarding “[The NHU Foundation’s] ability to implement the stated college preparatory program.” Moreover, the District Administration had “questions and concerns” regarding The NHU Foundation’s ability to “successfully implement the program set forth in the LCPA II petition….” The Board’s conditional approval included specific dates by which The NHU Foundation was to meet each condition.\n\t\t \nThe NHU Foundation met the Board-specified approval conditions for LVLA within the agreed upon timeline. During the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years, District staff has monitored the Latino College Preparatory Academy program and noted, not only that the educational program has improved, but also The NHU Foundation appears to be committed to offering a high quality educational program to students who attend its Latino College Preparatory Academy.   \n\t\t \nEducation Code § 47607 (a) (3) (A) establishes or sets forth as the most important criterion that a school board must consider in the renewal of a charter school, the school’s ability to show evidence of increased student achievement for all of its significant subgroups. LVLA opened its doors on August 11, 2014, and cannot provide sufficient evidence to meet this criterion before the charter expiration date, June 30, 2015.\n\t\t \nThe District Administration requests that the Board amend the term of the LVLA by three years to provide LVLA the full five-year term to collect student achievement data required by statute for renewal.    \n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees review and consider the District Administration's recommendation to amend the current two-year term of the Luis Valdez Leadership Academy Charter (to expire on June 30, 2015) to extend the charter by three years to end on June 30, 2018. \n\t\t \n\t \n",

Per Board Bylaw 9223, when a vacancy occurs four or more months before the end of a Board member's term, the Board shall, within 60 days of the date of the vacancy or the filing of the member's deferred resignation, either order an election or make a provisional appointment. If no election is ordered, then the Board will make a provisional appointment.\n\t \nBoard Bylaw 9223 specifies that the Board shall advertise in the local media to solicit “candidate applications or nominations.” Thus, the Board must decide whether it will seek applications or nominations for the upcoming Board vacancy. Per Board Bylaw 9223, the Board must also establish the timeline and the rules for the selection of the provisional appointees, and approve an application and a set of questions for all candidates to answer in writing. The Board must also appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of less than a quorum of the Board to ensure that applicants are eligible for Board membership as required by law. The applications of all eligible candidates will be forwarded to all Board members. The Board may appoint an advisory committee to, at a public meeting, review applications, interview candidates and make recommendations to the Board. The Board is not restricted by the advisory committee’s recommendation and may appoint any of the eligible applicants. The Board shall interview the candidates, of it’s choosing from the list of eligible applicants, at a public meeting, accept oral or written public input, and select the provisional appointee by a majority vote.\n\t\t \n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees establish the timeline and rules for the selection of the provisional appointee; approve an application and a set of questions for all candidates to answer in writing; and appoint an advisory committee to, at a public meeting, review applications, interview candidates and make recommendations to the Board.\n\t \n\t \n",
