The consortium’s membership is composed of five adult schools (East Side Adult Education, Campbell Adult and Community Education, Milpitas Adult School, Santa Clara Adult Education, and Silicon Valley Adult Education) and four colleges (San Jose City College, Evergreen Valley College, Mission College and West Valley College).  In March, the SBCAE’s three year plan to address gaps and to align and expand adult education services in the region was submitted to the California Department of Education.  That local plan, one of 71 in the state, informed the state of the consortium plan for adult education and determines the activities of SBCAE for the next three years. \n\t\t \nIn June, 2015, the Governor proposed and the Legislature approved an Adult Education Block Grant (AEBG) of dedicated funding.  A “maintenance of effort” funding level was carved out of AEBG that will support K-12 adult education.  Per the June legislation, AB104, additional funding in the 2015-2016 school year, and all AEBG in years following will need to be aligned to the local regional plans, and be approved by a board of consortium members.  \n\t\t \nII.   District Administration’s Recommendation\n\t\t \nAB104 requires all members to participate in decisions, and calls for publicly-noticed meetings of formal representatives of each member district.   Representatives from each consortium member must be approved by each member’s governance board.   In accordance with AB104, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees appoint Richard Uribe, Director of Adult Education, as primary ESUHSD representative to the Steering Committee of South Bay Consortium for Adult Education (SBCAE), and Tatiana Roganova, Supervisor of Adult Education, as alternate.\n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees appoint Richard Uribe, Director of Adult Education, as primary ESUHSD representative to the Steering Committee of South Bay Consortium for Adult Education (SBCAE), and Tatiana Roganova, Supervisor of Adult Education, as alternate.\n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, and Farshid Sasami, Program Manager, SGI\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action of Measure E Board/Cabinet Contingency Distribution \n\t \n$48,752,145 of Measure E Board/Cabinet Contingency remains unallocated. The Contingency was unallocated because the existing debt service could not support issuance of those bonds without exceeding the Proposition 39 tax rate cap. This is no longer the case, as property values have increased. With the rising cost of construction, together with the District’s unmet facilities needs, it is in the District’s best interest to allocate those funds and use them.\nAdministration developed three scenarios by which the Contingency may be allocated.\nScenario 1\nIn this scenario, funds would be allocated to cover specific unmet needs:\nReplacement of football field synthetic turf carpet ($4 million): Typically, synthetic turf carpet has a service life of ten years, depending on use. Six out of eleven synthetic turf football fields were installed in 2004/2005 (Andrew P. Hill, James Lick, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Santa Teresa, Yerba Buena High Schools). This funding would allow for replacement of synthetic turf carpet at these six schools.\nConstruction Cost Escalation contingency ($13 million):  Each of the schools is proceeding with their projects that were Board approved in 2014. Due to current construction market conditions, costs are escalating at a rate reminiscent of the early 21st Century during the dot-com boom.  In order to preserve the base scope of each school’s projects, this contingency set-aside would mitigate extraordinary construction cost escalation.  The monies would be pro-rated to each project’s construction cost and time schedule, the factors impacting cost escalation.  The alternative to providing a cost escalation contingency would be to de-scope projects to stay within budget.\nReplacement Music, Art and Administration Building & Central Quad Modernization at W.C. Overfelt High School ($19 million):  W.C. Overfelt is one of Santa Clara County’s underperforming schools.  This improved “front of campus” facility, with next generation learning facilities, will help to retain enrollment and improve student outcomes.  This funding would be an advance to W.C. Overfelt against future bond allocations.\nRoofs, Heating/Ventilating/Air Conditioning (HVAC), Electrical Infrastructure ($11.75 million):  There are 48 critical roofs at or beyond their service lives, and current funding for only 7 replacements.  There are over 600 HVAC units at or beyond their service lives, and current funding for only 100.  Of the 13 school sites with aged electrical distribution infrastructure, 5 sites have current funding for total and/or partial replacement.  Replacing roofs, mechanical and electrical infrastructure will ensure the reliability of facilities, increase classroom comfort, and reduce operating costs.  This proposed $11.75 million will not fund all these needs, but will allow replacement of the most critical of these items.\nGymnasium Windows Replacement at Andrew P. Hill High School ($1 million):  Windows in gyms are rare.  The windows at Andrew Hill’s gym lead to increased solar (heat) gain, increasing ventilation costs and thermal discomfort.  The windows are subject to vandalism.  The sun’s ultraviolet rays prematurely degrade the sacrificial finish on the wood floors.  Replacement of the glazing with a fiberglass-based translucent material would mitigate or resolve these issues.\nScenario 2\nIn this scenario, synthetic turf carpet replacement would be funded ($4 million), and the remaining Contingency would be allocated to school sites, using the 2012 Measure I allocation methodology as a framework for equity ($44.75 million).\nReplacement of football field synthetic turf carpet ($4 million)\nThe remaining Contingency would be allocated to school sites ($44.75 million).\nIn this scenario, each site would use their additional allocation to cover their construction cost escalation on current projects, and only after having satisfied that requirement could they initiate new projects.  Attachment A delineates the funding distribution for this Scenario 2.\nThe 2012 Measure I allocation methodology also allocated funds for technology. The 2014 Measure I Technology Bond covers the District’s technology needs, and so a Measure E Board Contingency allocation is not required or included for technology in the funding distribution delineated in Attachment A.\nThe 2012 Measure I allocation methodology also allocated funds for alternative education.  Alternative education needs are currently being addressed using previously-allocated bond funds, as well as Capital Facilities Fund 25 and School Facilities Fund 35.  The exceptions are Foothill and Phoenix High Schools, for which an appropriate amount of construction cost escalation for their approved projects is indicated in Attachment A.\nScenario 3\nThis Scenario is a hybrid between Scenarios 1 and 2.  Attachment B delineates the funding distribution for this Scenario 3.\nReplacement of football field synthetic turf carpet ($4 million)\nRoofs, Heating/Ventilating/Air Conditioning (HVAC), Electrical Infrastructure ($11.75 million)\nThe remaining Contingency would be allocated to school sites, following Scenario 2’s framework ($33 million).\n\t \n\t \nAdministration recommends Scenario 3. Scenario 3’s hybrid approach allows the District to fund synthetic turf and infrastructure needs that are not likely to be identified as priorities through school site facilities planning processes – and yet these items are critical to the continued operation of learning facilities that affect a great population of students and staff. Yet the hybrid approach allocates the majority of Contingency funding to sites so they can first cover the escalating construction costs of their current projects, and then self-determine priorities for any residual funds. This balanced approach satisfies the requirement to provide safe and effective learning facilities while continuing the Board’s methodology of allocating bond funds to school sites using an equity-driven distribution model.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$48,752,145\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure E general obligation bond funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the distribution of $48,752,145 of Measure E Board/Cabinet Contingency funds in accordance with the Equity Distributions – Measure E Board/Cabinet Contingency depicted on Attachment B (Scenario 3).\n\t \n",

Z-065-601) Lease Leaseback Construction Project with McCarthy Building Companies, Inc.\n\t\t\t \nOn June 19, 2014, the Board awarded a Preconstruction Agreement to McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. (McCarthy) to be the Lease Leaseback Developer for the Independence High School Modernization of Building B and Campus Site Improvement Projects (Item 15.03).\n\t\t\t \nUpon approval of the Preconstruction Agreement, McCarthy immediately began implementing components of their Agreement including reviewing the project plans and specifications prepared by Cody Anderson Architects (CAW) for constructability, technical review, value engineering, and obtaining pricing from subcontractors and suppliers to generate a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).\n\t\t\t \nOn June 18, 2015, the Board awarded a Site and Facilities Lease agreement for the interior demolition of Building B in order to be ready for construction upon DSA approval of plans and for the Campus Improvements, (Project No. Z-065-602).\n\t\t\t \nThe plans and specifications for the Modernization of Building B now have been approved by DSA.  Staff is now seeking Board approval for the Site and Facilities Lease Agreement to award the Building B reconstruction GMP cost.\n\t\t\t \nTo develop the GMP, McCarthy divided the plans and specifications into work categories (WC) or subcontractor trade areas.  McCarthy solicited multiple subcontractors to provide bids for each WC, including firms from the District’s prequalified list of contractors.  McCarthy interviewed the two lowest bid subcontractors for each WC to ensure that their bids contain the full scope and meet the experience and qualification criteria required by the contract documents. McCarthy provided their subcontractor pricing data used to prepare the GMP.\n\t\t\t \nAdditionally, in developing the GMP, McCarthy prepared a detailed list of assumptions and clarifications.  Each of these assumptions and clarifications were reviewed and accepted by Facilities staff, CAW and VPCS.  \n\t\t\t \nThrough this process of reviewing of the plans and specification for constructability and technical review issues, generating value engineering options and preparing the list of assumptions and clarifications, McCarthy developed their list of Owner contingency items.  This list was reviewed and edited by Facilities staff, VPCS and CAW.  As agreed by McCarthy, the Owner’s Contingency can only be used for a limited list of unforeseen conditions. McCarthy accepts the majority of design risk and unforeseen conditions associated with design conflicts.  McCarthy’s GMP reflects this acceptance of risk. \n\t\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nMeasure I - $2,477,273.00\nMeasure G - $794,945.00\nNot to Exceed $3,272,218.00\n\t\t\t \nFunding Source:\nGeneral Obligation Bond Measure I and G \n\t\t\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees award Site and Facilities Lease Agreements with McCarthy Building Companies, Inc., for the Building B (Project No. Z-065-601) Lease Leaseback GMP (Construction) Project, in an amount not to exceed $3,272,218.00 and authorize Administration to execute change orders in accordance with Board Policy 3312.1.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t \n",
