The District had many inequitable systems in place.\n\t\t \nThe District began changing policies and implementing programs to even the playing field.  All core subject sequences have only one path and it leads to college preparedness.  Many schools began to place students by default into a third year of math or science.  In the 2010/11 school year, the Board of Trustees approved a default pathway for all students that leads to college and career readiness.  The first class to graduate having completed four years of high school under the default pathway is the class of 2015.  The District set consistent placement criteria into core courses for all schools.  Resources were prioritized to implement summer programs for all students that would advance or support higher level math placement in high school.  Grants were procured to implement programs at sites to support struggling students.  The data in this report will show that these system changes have shown improvement in preparing all students for college and careers, but that the District still has a long way to go to achieve this goal.  The Strategic Plan sets the course for further improvement.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the report as presented.\n\t \n",
