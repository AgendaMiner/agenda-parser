Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance & Facilities, Randy Phelps, Director of Information Technology, Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager, and Jeanine Lovejoy, The Consulting Group\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action to Receive Report on Districtwide Security Cameras, and Approve Professional Service Contract for Design Services \n\t\t \n\t\t \nOn August 22, 2013 (Item 14.01), the Board received a report on the status of security cameras at our school sites.  Cameras installed in the past employ older technology, some of which is obsolete, and are ad hoc systems that do not or cannot integrate into an enterprise level solution.\n\t\t \nOn September 19, 2013 (Item 15.02), The Consulting Group was awarded a contract to study and report on the current condition of the District’s security cameras, and to provide recommendations toward a modern, integrated solution.  They conducted physical assessments of existing cameras, cabling, storage devices and technology platforms.  They also conducted a risk assessment by interviewing school site and district staff to ascertain areas of historic or perceived risk, as well as surveying each campus’ physical condition.  They have provided a comprehensive report that includes recommendations on how to migrate from existing disintegrated, legacy systems to an integrated, enterprise level solution that employs current technology (Executive Summary attached). The Consulting Group will present their findings and recommendations (presentation attached).\n\t\t \nThe estimated cost to implement a districtwide enterprise level, IP-based camera solution that provides coverage to all areas of each site as identified in the report is five million dollars ($5M).  Current bond Measure E funding available for this project is $1M.  Supplemental funding as follows could be allocated to support this project:  $1M of Capital Facilities Fund 25; $2M of bond Measure I infrastructure funding; $1M of School Facility Fund 35.  Administration recommends this comprehensive provision of security cameras, in order to provide coverage where needed to provide deterrence against unwanted behavior, detection and assessment of unwanted events, rapid assessment in a safety emergency, the ability to gather evidence and subjects of interest pursuant to immediate action or in support of a forensic investigation, at the lowest life cycle cost.  \n\t\t \nA possible scaled back option (Alternate Option 1) would be installation of an enterprise level, IP-based camera solution at only the sites that experience the highest incidents (e.g., Andrew Hill, Mount Pleasant, Silver Creek, Yerba Buena), as well as the District Office.  The estimated cost for this option would be $1.6M.  \n\t\t \nAnother scaled back option (Alternate Option 2) would be Option 1 plus replacement of broken cameras at other campuses.  The estimated cost for this option would be $2.8M.  \n\t\t \nAdministration recommends authorizing The Consulting Group to develop plans and specifications that would allow the District to bid and award an installation contract for the comprehensive districtwide, enterprise level, IP-based camera solution.  The preconstruction period (design, bid, approval and award) is estimated to take seven months.  Construction/installation team(s) would move from site to site within an estimated six to nine month period.  As each site is completed, their cameras would be fully operational.  With this schedule, an integrated, enterprise level security camera system that employs current technology would be in place by Spring 2015.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$260,000.00 \n           \n;\nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure E\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve a professional service contract for The Consulting Group, in the amount of $260,000, to develop plans and specifications for a Districtwide Security Camera System, and to delegate authority to the Superintendent or designee to amend the contract and purchase order on an as needed basis, including funding.\n\t \n",

Roberto Cruz Academy Charter School (“BRC”) dated April 29, 2013, and was received by the Board of Trustees on May 9, 2013.  A public hearing was held at the June 11, 2013, Regular Board Meeting pursuant to Education Code section 47605(a).  At the August 22, 2013, Regular Board Meeting the Governing Board approved the administration’s recommendation of a conditional approval for a term of 2 years to end on June 30, 2015.\n   \nCondition #1:  Petitioner must submit to the District documentation from UC Doorways that LCPA 1 has the minimum 15 courses required to certify students UC a-g eligible by April 15, 2014. \n \nLCPA 1 has submitted to UC Doorways the remaining courses needed to have the minimum 15 courses required to certify students are UC A-G eligible.  LCPA 1 is waiting for the courses to be reviewed by UC Doorways and subsequently notified if they are approved.  Condition is pending notification from UC Doorways and if one or more of the courses submitted is not approved, then LCPA 1 will have to continue the process until all 15 courses have been approved.  \n \nCondition #2:  Submit proof of intended enrollment by June 15, 2014, for LCPA 1, LCPA II, and BRC.  Such proof shall include signed statements from parents identifying their student by name, age, and grade level, and that they have enrolled or intended to enroll such student in LCPA 1, LCPA II or BRC. \n \nThis condition has not been met; however, this is addressed in the MOU approved by the Governing Board at the December 12, 2013, Regular Board Meeting.  An enrollment timeline has been established by the MOU and petitioners have to submit proof of enrollment by June 15, 2014, in order to open for the 2014-2015 school year.\n \nCondition #3:  Submit proof that the NHU Foundation has acquired an appropriate facility to house the BRC school with appropriate proof of insurance by July 1, 2014.\n \nCurrently, the petitioners have not submitted proof that they have obtained a facility; however, this is addressed in the MOU approved by the Governing Board at the December 12, 2013, Regular Board Meeting as part of the opening requirements and is due by July 1, 2014.  \n \nCondition #4:  Successfully negotiate an acceptable MOU agreement with the District by November 30, 2013.\n \nThe MOU was approved by the Governing Board at the December 12, 2013, Regular Board Meeting.\n \nThe MOU address the areas of: \n•         Establishment of the school and location \n•         The Authorizer – school relationship \n•         School opening criteria and timelines \n•         Budget and accounting timelines \n•         Authorizer authority parameters \n•         Special Education services \n•         Student conduct and discipline \n•         Evaluation \n•         Term of the charter \n•         Governance \n•         Student records and assessments \n•         Dispute resolution \n•         School closure procedures \n•         Insurance \n•         Human Resources \n•         Service contracts \n•         Any special conditions \n \n \nCondition #5:  Correct deficiencies in the charter petitions noted in the evaluation matrix submitted to the Board during these authorization proceedings by no later than January 30, 2014.\n \nNHU Foundation submitted a revised charter petition on December 18, 2013.  Staff is in the process of reviewing the petition to ensure that the deficiencies outlined in the evaluation matrix have been corrected and will continue to work with the petitioners until all deficiencies are corrected.\n \nAdministration feels that, although not all the conditions have been fully met, the NHU Foundation has made a good effort in meeting conditions #1, #4, and #5 and conditions #2 and #3 are guaranteed as a condition of opening in the MOU. The NHU Foundation has applied and was granted a charter school grant through the California Department of Education and, in order to receive these funds, they must submit a District authorized petition clear of any conditions.\n \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the District administration to sign off on the conditions of approval for the B.

The process built upon the planning work completed in 2008/2009 for Measure E, and mimicked the planning, recommendation and approval process put in place for Measure E, as follows:\n\t \nHistorical Analysis\n                 A review of past planning initiatives were conducted to ascertain projects that were identified, prioritized, and either implemented or deferred; those planning initiatives include the 2004 Facilities Master Plan, facilities condition and infrastructure studies, as well as previous Bond Measures A, G and E plans and outcomes.\nSchool Site Council Project Lists\n                 Historical analysis reports were reviewed by Facilities Planning and Bond Program Management staff, and Site administration.  School Site Councils collaborated with Site administration and Bond Planning staff to update their project lists. Project lists were developed and prioritized based on the District’s Strategic Plan, as well as the criteria upon which Measure I funding was allocated (API/SED/EL, SPED, Permanent Modernized Space Capacity)\nSuperintendent’s Council \n                 Proposed Project Lists were presented to Superintendent’s Council for review and recommendation.  In some instances when further discussion was warranted, a second round of review was conducted that included the school Principal.  As needed, School Site Councils were re-engaged for further discussion and approval.   \n\t \nThe 2013 Project Lists for Andrew Hill High School, Foothill High School, Independence High School, James Lick High School, Mt.

the strategic goal of the reorganization is to increase program quality while also realizing $1.3 million annual cost savings in comparison to what the District currently pays to have these services performed by SGI.  Implementation of the reorganization is underway.\n\t \nIn light of the Board-approved reorganization, the scope of the RFQ/P for program management services originally issued by the District in March 25, 2013, is no longer relevant or fully accurate.  Instead, the scope of work has been substantially narrowed, with a considerable amount of the financial management and accounting now to be performed and administered directly by District staff.  \n\t \nAfter review and consideration of the TSS performance audit report and the findings and recommendations, SGI’s experience and past performance, the recent RFQ/P process and the on-going capital program reorganization, Administration considers that SGI is best-positioned to continue to serve in the role and provide the services of Program Manager for Measure G, Measure E and Measure I, as now modified and narrowed by the capital program reorganization.  On that basis, Administration has been in on-going negotiations with SGI for a “Program Management Services Agreement for Measures “G”, “E” and “I” General Obligation School Facilities Bond Program”, which Administration now presents and recommends for Board approval (the “Proposed Agreement”).\n\t \nThe proposed Agreement has the following key material terms:\n\t \nEffective Date:  February 1, 2014.\n\t \nTerm of Agreement:  Initial period of February 1, 2014 – December 1, 2017; two (2) additional one-year renewal options at District’s discretion.  (Art. XVI(3).)\n\t \nProgram Management Fee:  Total fee not to exceed $6,612,505.00 (3.7%), allocated between Measure G, Measure E, and Measure I and based on a total combined Bond Program budget of $178,744,481, as follows:\n\t \nBond Program\nBudget Per Bond Program\nMaximum Fee per Bond Program\nMeasure G\n$43,444,931.00\n$1,607,176.00\nMeasure E\n$27,422,019.00\n$1,014,209.00\nMeasure I\n$107,877,531.00\n$3,991,120.00\nTotals\n$178,744,481.00\n$6,612,505.00\n\t \n\t \n(Proposed Agreement, Art. XV and Art. XVI)\n\t \nTermination Rights:  The proposed Agreement, as with previous agreements, contains a termination provision including rights of termination for cause and termination for convenience upon 60-days written notice by District.\n\t \nThe proposed Agreement addresses the issues, recommendation and deficiencies raised in the 2010 FCMAT Extraordinary Audit and in the September 2013, TSS Performance Audit.  Approval of the proposed Agreement will result in the termination of the existing Measure G and Measure E program management agreements effective February 1, 2014.  (Art.
