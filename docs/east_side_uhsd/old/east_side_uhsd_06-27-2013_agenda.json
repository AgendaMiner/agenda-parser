The district will continue to closely monitor and report on the State’s budget circumstances and how it impacts the district as information becomes available.         \n\t\t \nThe 2013-14 budget indicates that the district is recommending that a positive budget be adopted based on the district’s ability to maintain sufficient reserves for the upcoming and two subsequent fiscal years. The attached budget book with executive summary provides a more detailed analysis of the FY 2013-14 district budget and required State SACS reporting forms.  \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and adopt the annual budget for 2013-14 with a positive certification for the 2013-14 fiscal year and two subsequent years. \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of Board Member Compensation/Adjustments to Compensation per Education Code Section 35120\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \nThis item addresses the Board Members’ monthly compensation allowable under the Education Code for the 2013-2014 school year and requests and recommends:\n\t\t \nBoard action reducing the monthly stipend for the 2013-2014 school year as required by the Education Code in light of a recent reduction in ADA; and\nApprove a 5% increase in the monthly stipend (based on the new, lower monthly rate) as provided in the Education Code.\n\t\t \nMonthly Stipend Amount\n\t\t \nThe calculation of Board members’ monthly compensation is governed by Education Code section 35120.  Monthly compensation to Board members during any school year is based upon average daily attendance during the prior school year.  Pursuant to the Education Code, the maximum monthly compensation District Board members could receive would be $750.00.  (However, on May 6, 2010, the Board voted to take a 10% reduction in its monthly compensation consistent with budget cuts affecting employees as a result of the State’s economic crisis.  Therefore, as a result of that 2010 action Board members currently receive monthly compensation of $675.00.)  Education Code section 35120(a)(3) provides:\n\t\t \n“In any school district in which the average daily attendance for the prior school year was 60,000, or less, but more than 25,000, each member of the city board of education or the governing board of the district who actually attends all meetings held may receive as compensation for his or her services a sum not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) in any month.”  (Emphasis added)\n\t\t \nHowever, if ADA for the prior school year is more than 10,000 but less than 25,001, then the Board member monthly stipend is governed Section 35120(a)(4) which provides:\n\t\t \n“In any school district in which the average daily attendance for the prior school year was 25,000, or less, but more than 10,000, each member of the city board of education or the governing board of the district who actually attends all meetings held may receive as compensation for his or her services a sum not to exceed four hundred dollars ($400) in any month.”\n\t\t \nDistrict staff has calculated ADA for the 2012-2013 school year at 22,514.51.  (See Attachment 1)  ADA for the 2012-2013 school year for Adult Education, which is calculated separately, totaled 1440.16.  (See Attachment 2)  The District does not report or receive apportionments for ADA for charter school students or MetroED.\n\t\t \n For purposes of calculating Board member compensation, Education Code Section 35120(a)(9) further provides:\n\t\t \n“For the purposes of providing compensation pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (7), inclusive, average daily attendance for the prior school year may be increased by a school district’s percentage of excused absences reported for the 1996–97 fiscal year.” (Emphasis added)\n\t\t \nDuring the 1996-1997 fiscal year excused absences accounted for 0.04426% of the District’s reported ADA (955.58 ADA for excused absences out of 21,589.34 total ADA).\n\t\t \nBased on the above data, ADA for purposes of calculating Board member compensation for the 2013-2014 school year pursuant to Education Codes section 35120 is determined as follows:\n\t\t \n           \n2012-2013 Avg. Daily Attendance (Attach. 1)\n22,514.51\n2012-2013 Adult Ed. Avg. Daily Attend. (Attach. 2)\n1,440.16\nAdjustment/Increase for 1996-1997 excused absences per Educ. Code section 35120(a)(9)1\n996.49 (22,514.51 x 0.04426)\nTotal Avg. Daily Attendance per §35120\n24,951.16\n\t\t \nPursuant to Education Code section 35120(a)(4), and because average daily attendance for 2012-2013 was less than 25,000, the monthly compensation for Board Members for 2013-2014 should be reduced to $400.00, effective as of July 1, 2013.\n                                   \nStatutorily Allowable Increase to Board Member Compensation \n\t\t \nThe reduction in compensation to $400 per month will result in a 47% reduction in monthly compensation to Board Members below the statutorily allowed amount ($750).  Education Code section 35120(e) provides:\n\t\t \n“On an annual basis, the governing board may increase the compensation of individual board members beyond the limits delineated in this section, in an amount not to exceed 5 percent based on the present monthly rate of compensation. Any increase made pursuant to this section shall be effective upon approval by the governing board.”\n\t\t \nNotwithstanding section 35120(e), it appears that the Board has never taken any action to implement a 5% increase to the monthly compensation as allowed by law.  On that basis, Administration recommends that, once the Board has approved the reduction in the monthly compensation to $400.00 consistent with the above analysis resulting from the reduction in ADA, the Board then approve a 5% increase to the Board Member compensation to take effect July 1, 2013, resulting in a new monthly compensation per Board Member of $420.00 pursuant to Education Code section 35120(e).\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nEstimated $19,800 in savings to the General Fund\n                                                                                              \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nUnrestricted General Fund\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAdministration recommends that the Board:\nApprove the reduction in Board Member monthly compensation from $750 to $400 pursuant to Education Code section 35120, effective July 1, 2013; and\nApprove a 5% increase in Board Member monthly compensation to $420 per month effective July 1, 2013, pursuant to Education Code section 35120(e).\nâ\n1The 0.04426 adjustment factor is applied to the 22,514.51 ADA reported by the District at P-2, not including Adult Education, since the 1996-1997 report submitted by the District to the State calculated ADA for excused absences only as to grades 9-12, continuation education and special education students, and did not include Adult Education students.\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n",

Yerba Buena High School is in Year 4 and have been working with the district to analyze progress and construct a plan. \n\t \nSchools in Program Improvement Year 4 are required to do the following:\nCreate a District and School Liaison Team (DSLT).  This team leads the school through the PI Year 4 planning process and chooses a restructuring/alternative governance plan. A  DSLT was created at both sites following the state suggested composition, that is, supervisor of the principal, curriculum and instruction administrator, classroom teachers, member of the school’s advisory council, parents, and other informed individuals. Each DSLT met twice and followed the CDE recommended protocol to select appropriate alternative governance option(s) and revise the Single Plan for Student Achievement.\nAllow adequate opportunity for teachers and parents to comment before taking action. With assistance from committee members, information was shared and stakeholders had opportunities to comment on suggested plans.\nChoose one of the four following options as their restructuring/alternative governance structure. \nClose the school and reopen it as a charter school.\nReplace all or most of the school staff (which may include the principal) who are relevant to the failure to make AYP.\nEnter into a contract with an entity, such as a private management company with a demonstrated record of effectiveness, to operate the public school.\nImplement any other major restructuring of the school’s governance arrangement that makes fundamental reforms and leads to improved student achievement. \nAfter completing the CDE recommended protocol, Yerba Buena selected D, that is, to implement an alternative governance structure.\n\t \nYerba Buena’s school plan for alternative governance structure - The main focus areas of their alternative governance structure are as follows:\nImplementation of the 7 period day to increase the school's capacity to offer advisory periods, intervention services and allow the implementation of additional collaboration time to incorporate the Professional learning community.\nImplement Professional Learning Communities with the goal of analyzing subject and department level data in regards to student achievement.\nImplement common assessments in all core subject areas.\nImplement Linked Learning/Pathways Model that will divide the school into two school of focus, Humanities and STEM.  Entering freshman will have the ability to choose between one of two schools.\nEnsure that the school’s Single Plan for Student Achievement reflects the alternative governance structure chosen above.\nThe alternative governance structure is represented in Yerba Buena’s Single Plan for Student Achievement.\n\t \nThe DSLT will continue to meet on a regular basis at both high schools to look at student achievement data and monitor the alternative governance plan. \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION: \nIt is recommended that the Governing Board Approve the Alternative Governance Structure at Yerba Buena High School.\n",

The data compares juniors district-wide with Hispanic juniors, and Asian juniors. Dropouts of the class of 2011/12 are analyzed and compared to the class of 2010/11 to determine any change to the percent of completer dropouts.

Funk, Superintendent\nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, and Kenneth Kerch, AIA, SGI Bond Program Manager\nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of Measure I Equity Distribution\n\t \nAn equity distribution methodology was Board approved to fairly allocate Measure I funding in accordance with District priorities (June 11, 2013, Board Item 15.03).  The methodology is a weighted allocation of funds to comprehensive high schools in accordance with the following three categories:\nAPI/SED/EL Distribution:  the greatest share is allocated to the schools with the lowest Academic Performance Index scores, the highest numbers of Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroup members, and the highest numbers of English Learner subgroup members.  This combination of published data that is readily accessible and understood is equally weighted to derive the rankings.  Administration proposes a weight of 30% in this first category.\nThe first Measure E category was Academic Performance Distribution (30%), wherein the greatest share was allocated to the lowest academic performers.  For Measure I this category remains consistent with a proposed weight of 30%.\nSPED Distribution:  the greatest share is allocated to schools with the highest number of students qualifying for special education services.  Special education has unique facilities needs with associated costs; this allocation category recognizes that schools with the greatest number of students qualifying for special education services also has the greatest need for higher cost facilities to support special education curriculum.   Administration proposes a weight of 10% in this second category.\nThe second Measure E category was Bond Share Distribution (30%), wherein the greatest share was allocated to campuses that received the least amounts of previous bond measure monies.  Funding equity between schools was achieved, therefore this category is now focused on SPED with a proposed weight of 10%.\nPermanent Modernized Capacity Distribution:  the greatest share is allocated to schools with the greatest need to eliminate portables and modernize original permanent spaces.  This goal of the 2004 Facilities Master Plan has not yet been fully realized, and remains an important aspect of achieving the best possible learning environment.  There are currently in excess of 260 owned and/or leased portable, temporary buildings at our school sites, many of which are approaching and/or exceeding their intended service life.  Funds expended on maintaining and repairing portable inventory are not as prudent an investment, due to the ultimately temporary nature of portable building construction.  This Measure I distribution category aligns funding with modernization of permanent facilities.  Administration proposes a weight of 35% in this first category.\nThe third Measure E category was Academic Master Plan Distribution (20%), wherein funds were allocated to specific projects based on School Site Council priorities.  For Measure I a weight of 35% is proposed to provide greater emphasis on modernizing permanent facilities not touched by previous bonds. \nAdditionally, the methodology provides an allocation of funds to:\nAlternative Education Distribution\nThe Alternative Education Distribution for Measure E was 10%.  A significant amount of work was accomplished in Measure E in this category.  Although the proposed allocation of 15% is an increased percentage, it is based on a significantly smaller dollar value.  The proposed allocation is based on projected needs anticipated to be identified as a result of the District’s strategic planning initiative, which may include special education, small but necessary schools, and other alternative education components.\nTechnology Distribution\nThe Technology Distribution for Measure E was 10%.  For Measure I this category remains consistent with a proposed weight of 10%.\nThe Measure I Equity Distribution worksheet (Attachment A) shows Administration’s proposed weight (indicated as a percentage share) to be allocated in each category.  Based on the rankings of each site within each category, the worksheet indicates the proposed Measure I dollars that would be distributed to each site, by category and cumulatively.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$34,085,000                                                   \n                                                                                               \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure I general obligation bond funds\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize the distribution of $34,085,000 of Measure I funds to District sites in accordance with the Equity Distributions – Measure I depicted on Attachment A. \n",
