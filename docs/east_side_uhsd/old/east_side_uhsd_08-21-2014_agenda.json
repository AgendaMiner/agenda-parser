Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy Charter\n\t\t\t \n                                                                                                \nI. Brief Introduction and Summary\n\t\t\t \nOn August 23, 2013, the East Side Union High School District Board of Trustees (Board) approved the charter petition for B. Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy (BRC), granting the NHU Foundation permission to operate BRC within the boundaries of the East Side Union High School District, located in San Jose, California. The Board granted the NHU Foundation for BRC, a term of two years to end on June 30, 2015. BRC was scheduled to open fall 2014.\n\t\t\t \nOn August 6, 2014, the East Side Union High School District received a letter (Attachment A) and \"revised\" three-year budget (Attachment B) from the NHU Foundation informing the District of its intention to delay the opening of BRC until fall 2015. The request for a delay in opening requires a material revision to the term of the charter. The original term of the charter was for two years with an ending date of June 30, 2015. The NHU Foundation is requesting to extend the term of the charter by one year, to end on June 30, 2016. The reason given by the NHU Foundation for the one-year delay is to have \"more time to plan and recruit students.\"\n\t\t\t \nII.Standard for Review/Denial Authorization\n\t\t\t \nPursuant to Education Code § 47607 (a) (1), the Board must consider whether to approve the material revision. Education Code § 47607 (a) (2) requires that “material revisions of charters” are to “be governed by the standards and criteria in Section 47605.” Therefore, if the Board should decide to deny NHU’s material revision request for BRC, then the Board must make “written factual findings,” specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:\n\t\t\t \n(1)  The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.\n(2)  The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\n(3)  The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).\n(4)  The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (d).\n(5)  The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the required elements.\n\t\t\t \nFindings #1, #3, #4 and #5 would not be applicable.  If the Board decides to deny the request to delay the opening of BRC by one year to August 2015, it must make “written factual findings” with respect to Finding #2.  \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe Administration recommends that the Board approve the material revision request to the term of the B. Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy charter to extend by one year the opening to fall 2015. The two-year term of the charter would end on June 30, 2016.  \n\t\t\t \n\t \n",
