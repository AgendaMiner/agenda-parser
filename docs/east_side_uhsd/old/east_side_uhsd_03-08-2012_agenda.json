For that reason, and upon the guidance and advice of the District’s Legal Counsel, the Superintendent has recused himself and will recuse himself from the Board discussion and consideration of this matter and will recuse himself from any involvement in the creation and administration of the SERP if it is approved by the Board in its current proposed form or as it may be amended or modified.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t*******************************************\n\t\t\t \nThis resolution will enable the District to offer an incentive to Certificated Non-Management employees to retire effective June 30, 2012.  There were a total of 77 certificated non-management employees who decided to retire now.  The average age for all retirees is 62.5 years and their average years of service is 29.6 years.  Employees were required to meet certain eligibility requirements as stated in the resolution in order to participate in the plan.  The cost of the incentive is offset by the savings realized by reducing positions and/or filling positions at a lower salary.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNet Savings of $2.4 million over 5 years\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund-Benefits\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt amended resolution 2011/2012-08A Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) for Certificated Non-Management Employees.\n\t \n",
