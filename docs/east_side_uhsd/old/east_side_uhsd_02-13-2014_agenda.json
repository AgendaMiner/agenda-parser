The OW team reviewed the audit answers and research conducted by ESUHSD to create a positioning document. The positioning document contained their unique and market relevant attributes of East Side. The positioning document guided the logo design process and will be used to guide internal and external marketing efforts moving forward.\n\t \n After review and refinement, the executive committee approved the positioning statement and the logo design exploration began.\n\t \nThe committee was then presented with several logo concepts. A review and refinement process brought forth one approved design and tagline for ESUHSD.\n\t \nOrloff Williams also produced guidelines to ensure that the new brand tagline letterhead and other business stationery are produced correctly.\n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the new district logo and the guidelines to be used for the brand tagline, letterhead and other business stationary and/or reproduction of the logo.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

Pleasant, and W.C. Overfelt High Schools. \n\t \nAn identical planning process to that implemented for the first group of schools approved in January was followed for this second group. The inclusive and collaborative planning process identified needs and developed recommendations for how each site would use Measure I allocations. The process built upon the planning work completed in 2008/2009 for Measure E, and mimicked the planning, recommendation and approval process put in place for Measure E, as follows:\n\t \nHistorical Analysis\nA review of past planning initiatives were conducted to ascertain projects that were identified, prioritized, and either implemented or deferred; those planning initiatives include the 2004 Facilities Master Plan, facilities condition and infrastructure studies, as well as previous Bond Measures A, G and E plans and outcomes.\n\t \nSchool Site Council Project Lists\nHistorical analysis reports were reviewed by Facilities Planning and Bond Program Management staff, and Site administration. School Site Councils collaborated with Site administration and Bond Planning staff to update their project lists. Project lists were developed and prioritized based on the District’s Strategic Plan, as well as the criteria upon which Measure I funding was allocated (API/SED/EL, SPED, Permanent Modernized Space Capacity).\n\t \nSuperintendent’s Council\nProposed Project Lists were presented to Superintendent’s Council for review and recommendation. In some instances when further discussion was warranted, a second round of review was conducted that included the school Principal. As needed, School Site Councils were re-engaged for further discussion and approval.  \n\t \nThe 2013 Project Lists for Evergreen Valley High School, Oak Grove High School, Piedmont Hills High School, Silver Creek High School, Santa Teresa High School, Phoenix High School, and Yerba Buena High School are presented herewith for Board discussion and approval.\n\t \nWith the exception of Yerba Buena High School, each school’s proposed projects are within their Board-allocated funding. Yerba Buena’s list proposes projects that exceed their funding allocation by $2 million. Although Yerba Buena’s project list indicates three projects, those three projects are subcomponents of the Student Commons project that will provide a comprehensive, integrated and efficient facility for provision of academic and student support services focusing on improving student achievement. The Student Commons will include a dining area that can also be used for assemblies or other functions, academic spaces to support project-based learning, academic spaces for digital media, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) classrooms, Library/Media Center, Health Clinic, MST (Multi Service Team) areas, ASB (Associated Student Body) offices, School Bank, staff support areas including a copy/mail center, a Student Parent Center, and administrative offices. The Student Commons will become the major hub and focal point on the campus, opening to, activating and energizing the adjacent central quadrangle. This Student Commons project is directly tied to the District’s mission that every student graduates prepared for college and career, empowered to thrive in a global society; it will facilitate how teachers teach and how students demonstrate their learning, transforming the educational environment at Yerba Buena High School. Administration believes this Student Commons project merits an advance of $2 million of future capital monies to Yerba Buena High School to bring this project to fruition.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \nNot Applicable                                    \n                                                                                               \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the 2013 Project Lists for Evergreen Valley, Oak Grove, Piedmont Hills, Silver Creek, Santa Teresa, Phoenix, and Yerba Buena High Schools.
