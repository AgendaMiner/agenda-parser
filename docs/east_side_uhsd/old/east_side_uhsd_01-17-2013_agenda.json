His vision, outlined in the 1996 bestselling book, Synchronicity: The Inner Path to Leadership, was to establish an organization dedicated to bringing together leaders from diverse sectors of the community to explore leadership philosophies, increase their capacity and strengthen their commitment to work together on public issues.\n\t \nALF has evolved over the past two and a half decades, attracting many of Silicon Valley's most influential leaders from all sectors. Today, ALF is on the radical edge of 21st century leadership and community change theory and practice. The program centers on a sophisticated and nuanced approach to leadership, generative dialogues, and the creation of diverse networks able to ignite positive transformation in Silicon Valley.\n\t \nThe Single Issue Education Classes will create a new and dynamic 21st century network of networks. This relationship-based network will place an emphasis on the quality of interactions and connections among its members. The network will create a container in which education leaders, forward thinkers, business pioneers, and passionate change makers will tackle the thorniest issues facing education in Silicon Valley. And it will be equipped to transform the ecosystem because of ALF’s unique process for creating transformative networks.\n\t \nThe Single Issue Education Class is framed around the following questions:\n\t \nHow will we take the best of what we have, transform the rest, and create an education system that inspires 21st century students to reach their potential?\nHow will we move what is standing in our way of a visionary future?â¨\nHow will we pave the paths to carry success from one place to another?\nHow will WE change, so that our children can fulfill their dreams?\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nAll authorized expenses as stipulated by the Board of Trustees\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Fund - Superintendent\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Superintendent to become a Fellow of the American Leadership Forum - Silicon Valley - as a Member of the Single Issue Education Class of 2013 as presented above.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

Code for Measure I, it is proposed that the existing Citizens Oversight Committee take on the additional responsibility for future Measure I Bond issues.  The attached resolution designates the existing Citizens Oversight Committee to have oversight responsibilities for Measure I Bonds, and amends the Bylaws of the Committee to implement Measure I.  The amended Bylaws also incorporate a recent amendment to the Ed. Code which permits members of the committee to serve for three consecutive terms.  Prior to the amendment of the Ed.

Funk, Superintendent\nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities,and Lorraine Guerin, Bond Program Deputy Manager, Seville Group, Inc.\nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Receive Report of Status of Measure G and Measure E, and Capital Improvement Program\n\t \nThe District’s Capital Improvement Program is a complex portfolio of projects, spanning multiple years and funded by local general obligation bond measures A, G, E and I, OPSC school facility program grants, and other minor funding streams.  On September 20, 2012, Bond Program Manager Bob Bush presented an annual update of the bond program (see Attachment A).  This report provides additional information about current program activities and status.\n\t \n33 Measure E Phase 1 projects are in the process of being closed out.  Project closeout includes receiving final deliverables from vendors (contractors, architects, inspectors, testing labs, furniture/fixture suppliers, construction managers, etc.), making final payments and liquidating any excess financial commitments; finalizing labor compliance certifications; finalizing activities related to subcontractor and supplier payment certifications; a final project-level budget reconciliation and liquidation; and final records management activities.\n5 Measure E Phase 1 projects are in construction.  We are using this opportunity to review standard procedures and activities that occur at or near the end of construction, to ensure a smooth handoff to operations and maintenance.  These include but are not limited to training administration and staff on the new facility and its security, lighting, mechanical and other systems; securing as-built drawings and specifications; securing Operations & Maintenance Manuals as well as spare parts/attic stock for equipment and products; and receiving warranty certificates, logs and procedural information.\n17 Measure E Phase 2 projects are in the preconstruction phase, which includes programming, design, approval by the Division of the State Architect, bidding and contract award.  Budget reconciliation occurs during each of these phases of preconstruction.\n1 Measure E Phase 2 project is in construction.   We are using this opportunity to review standard procedures and activities that occur during construction, to ensure safety and communication protocols are in place, to manage contract change orders, to ensure timely deliverables from professional service providers, and to plan subsequent activities such as FF&E provisioning, training and closeout.  \n32 Measure G site improvement projects have been completed, and are in the closeout process.\nWe reviewed the remaining 75 Measure G site improvements projects against Measure E Phase 2 and Phase 3 projects to identify potential synergies, looking for opportunities to bundle work for efficiency.\nWe have identified procurement strategies and timelines to be used on the remaining Measure G site improvement projects.   Those strategies include design/bid/build, CUPCCAA informal bidding procedures, energy service and conservation contracts, and utilizing California Multiple Award Schedules (CMAS).  We anticipate numerous contract awards in the first half of 2013, with construction rollout thereafter.\n\t \nA status report is provided for your information (Attachment B).  The report includes information about the 163 current projects, funded by bond measures E, G, I and miscellaneous other minor funding streams.  The information is provided in dashboard format by site/program, and includes information on approved projects, budgets, funding sources, and status.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive the Measure G and Measure E, and Capital Improvement Program status report.\n",
