Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion/Action to Review Relationship between San Jose Police Department Campus Security Services and Student Discipline Issues\n\t \n\t \nIn August, we received a Public Records Request from NBC Bay Area News Investigative Unit, along with other districts in the Bay Area, requesting information regarding the number of students referred to police and issued a police citation.  These records are sent to the US Department of Education Data Collection, Office of Civil Rights, every two years.  We provided the data to NBC and I was interviewed in early September. \n\t \nThe focus of the story was School-to-Prison Pipeline with the underlying premise being that having police officers on campus leads to an increase in police referrals, thus increasing the number of police citations that are issued.\n\t \nNBC focused on our District's data comparing 2011/2012 to 2013/14.  In 2011/12, there were 1,745 police referrals and 214 school-related arrests.  In 2013/14, there were 230 police referrals and 15 school-related arrests.\nWe need to peel the onion back further to understand the data and the types of offenses that occurred that lead to the police citation.  Although the trend data is going down in a positive direction and the District has implemented policy changes that should continue to improve the data, there is still much research to complete and a full discussion needs to take place.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board add this discussion item to the agenda of the November Board Study Session and that staff bring forward the data needed to have a full, transparent dialogue on police interaction with students and the number and type of citations that are issued by school and by ethnicity.\n\t \n",
