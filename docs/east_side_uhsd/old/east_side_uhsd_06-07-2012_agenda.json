Pursuant to Education Code 47605, a public hearing is required within thirty (30) days following the submission of a renewal charter school petition to the district.  The renewal petition was submitted to the district on April 19, 2012.\n\t \nDuring the Public Hearing, the Governing Board of the school district shall consider the level of support for the petition by the teachers employed by the district, other employees of the district and parents. The public hearing was held during the May 10, 2012 meeting where SJCC gave a presentation and had many supporters in attendance.   The Governing Board shall either grant or deny the charter renewal within sixty (60) days of receipt of the petition. The decision will be made at the June 7, 2012 Board Meeting.\n\t \nSan Jose Conservation Corp is an adult education program that focuses on Vocational Training supported with a high school diploma program. SJCC focuses on recruiting at risk young adults who are high school dropouts. In 2010-11 alone, 45% of their population is on probation or parole, 62% are gang involved, 36% are young parents, and 16% are students with disabilities. This makes SJCC a unique school with a unique population of students. They issued 464 high school diplomas, 213 vocational certificates, 180 students enrolled in community college, and 120 students enrolled in apprenticeship programs. \n\t \nA team of district experts from the Instructional Division, Business Division, and Human Resources Division reviewed the charter renewal proposal and visited both SJCC sites. Their findings are included in the renewal matrix. \n\t \n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the renewal of San Jose Conservation Corp charter.  The charter will be renewed for 5 years and will expire, June 30, 2017.\n",

Oak Grove High School and W. C.

A  DSLT was created at both sites following the state suggested composition, that is, supervisor of the principal, curriculum and instruction administrator, classroom teachers, member of the school’s advisory council, parents, and other informed individuals. Each DSLT met twice and followed the CDE recommended protocol to select appropriate alternative governance option(s) and revise the Single Plan for Student Achievement.\nAllow adequate opportunity for teachers and parents to comment before taking action. With assistance from committee members, information was shared and stakeholders had opportunities to comment on suggested plans.\nChoose one of the four following options as their restructuring/alternative governance structure. \nClose the school and reopen it as a charter school.\nReplace all or most of the school staff (which may include the principal) who are relevant to the failure to make AYP.\nEnter into a contract with an entity, such as a private management company with a demonstrated record of effectiveness, to operate the public school.\nImplement any other major restructuring of the school’s governance arrangement that makes fundamental reforms and leads to improved student achievement. \nAfter completing the CDE recommended protocol, Oak Grove and W. C. Overfelt selected D, that is, to implement an alternative governance structure.\n\t \nOak Grove’s school plan for alternative governance structure - The main focus areas of their alternative governance structure are as follows:\nRestructure professional development to focus on proven instructional strategies using best practices and regularly scheduled teacher/administrator classroom walkthroughs.\nImplement both common and formative assessments to better align instruction with pacing guides ensuring all students have equal access to the content standards.\nDevelop a timely and effective intervention plan to increase student success.\nW.

The Plan should be periodically reviewed and updated as needed, but at least once each year. The LEA Plan can serve as a summary of all existing state and federal programs and establish a focus for raising the academic performance of all student groups to achieve state academic standards. \n\t \nThe approval of a Local Educational Agency Plan by the local school board and State Board of Education is a requirement for receiving federal funding subgrants for NCLB programs. The LEA Plan includes specific descriptions and assurances as outlined in the provisions included in NCLB. In essence, LEA Plans describe the actions that LEAs will take to ensure that they meet certain programmatic requirements, including student academic services designed to increase student achievement and performance, coordination of services, needs assessments, consultations, school choice, supplemental services, and others as required. \n\t \nThe last board approved complete LEA Plan was in 2002. Since that time the district has annually updated the addendum to the LEA Plan, incorporating all Program Improvement recommendations provided by the district outside evaluator as required by law. The state strongly suggests that districts write a new LEA Plan rather than use an Addendum. Following this suggestion, the district, with input from all stakeholders, has written a new LEA Plan based on a updated District Assistance and intervention Report of Findings and Recommendations completed in may 2012 which is included in this board item. Additionally the plan  addresses  Common Core State Standards transition, and our districts focus on college and career readiness for all students. \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n\tNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\n\tNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION: \nIt is recommended that the board approve the LEA Plan. \n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

This is the second of three presentations of the budget to the Governing Board.  The preliminary budget is the result of a culmination of budget development activities between the sites, departments, and cabinet which provide a basis for the final budget.  The preliminary budget presentation is summarized first by providing an update on the District’s FYE 2011-12 budget, State budget update, and preliminary assumptions.  The FY 2011-12 budget is presented to provide year end projections for revenues, expenses, and ending fund balance. After reviewing the fiscal year end 2011-12 summary, major budget assumptions for developing the 2012-13 budget will be discussed including School Services dartboard, enrollment and ADA, and salaries and benefits.  The impact and adjustments based on the Governor’s May Revisions have been announced and are reflected in this second preliminary budget update.  \nThe preliminary budget presentation summarizes the projected estimate for general fund revenues and expenses for the budget year 2012-13 and for the multi-year thru 2014-15 and incorporates all proposed savings, additions and adjustments to the district’s budget.  The presentation concludes with a summary of proposed actions and next steps in the budget process.  The final budget will be presented for budget adoption at the Governing Board’s June 21 meeting.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo be determined \n\t \n",

Time is of the essence in these kinds of situations. The work needs to proceed immediately as the longer the soot and debris remains in place the more difficult the odor removal process can be and the smoke and soot will have a corrosive effect on the Facility and its contents. The Emergency Resolution enables the District to forgo the normal time frame and processes related to the work on the electrical junction box and the building which has been damaged and to engage a contractor(s) for the repair and remediation work without advertising for or inviting bids.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nUNKNOWN AT THIS TIME\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nProperty/Liability\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution 2011/2012-38 declaring an emergency pursuant to Public Contract Code section 1104 and 20113 and authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into contracts for the repair and remediation of the fire damage at Evergreen Valley High School.\n\t \n",
