The following steps have been taken so far:\n\t \nThe California Foreign Language Project (CFLP) has been contacted to design a Chinese Language program for East Side. We have received a verbal commitment from the president of the CFLP that they will work with East Side on this project. The CFLP operates out of Stanford University and the contract for services between the CFLP and ESUHSD is being reviewed by Stanford officials. We have been told to expect the contract sometime in September for our review. Upon our approval, it will be submitted to the Board for official approval.\nThe creation of the program will cost the district an estimated $50,000. and once created will operate under normal expenditures.\nMark Mao and the local Chinese community have plans in motion to begin soliciting donations to help defray the cost of the program design. An account with the East Side Foundation has been setup to receive funds to support the program. Lorraine Guerin has created letters and a flyer that the local community can use to help in their solicitation efforts.\n",

Notice of the Resolution was published and posted as required by law. The Resolution and the published and posted Notice of Intention to Lease specified that the District would receive sealed proposals to lease from interested parties up to 5:00 p.m. on August 29, 2011. Pursuant to Education Code sections 17472 and 17473, all sealed proposals received by the District in accordance with the Resolution and the Notice of Intention to Lease shall be opened, examined and declared by the Board in public session. Before accepting the sealed proposals, the Board shall call for oral bids upon the terms outlined in Section 17473.\n\tAt the time of the August 30, Board meeting, Administration will present to the Board all sealed proposals received by the District in accordance with the Resolution and the Notice of Intention to Lease.\n\tPursuant to Education Code section 17529, a school district may enter into a lease agreement for the joint use of operating school sites provided the Board first determines that the joint occupancy/use of such property will not: (1) interfere with the education program or activities of any school or class conducted upon the real property or in any building; (2) unduly disrupt the residents in the surrounding neighborhood; and (3) jeopardize the safety of the children of the school. At the September 17, 2009, Regular Board Meeting, the Board held a public hearing to solicit community input on the potential leasing of District property for such purposes.\n\tAt the time of the August 30, meeting, and per the earlier agenda item for the opening of sealed proposals, the Board will open all sealed proposals received by the District. Once opened, the proposals will be reviewed by staff and a recommendation made to the Board. Final acceptance of the Board may be made by majority vote at the time of the August 30, meeting (provided the Board first makes the determinations set forth in the preceding paragraph). Alternatively, the Board may reject any and all received bids (either written or oral) and withdraw the property from lease if it deems such action to be for the best public interest. (Education Code section 17476).   \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nLease - Revenue to be Determined\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAdministration recommends that all sealed proposals to lease received by the District in accordance with the Resolution and the Notice of Intention to Lease be reviewed by staff.\n\tAdministration recommends that the Board find that the joint occupancy/use of District as proposed in the Resolution will not: (1) Interfere with the education program or activities of any school or class conducted upon the real property or in any building; (2) unduly disrupt the residents in the surrounding neighborhood; (3) jeopardize the safety of the children of the school as indicated by the independent analysis for each installation performed by Hammett & Edison, Inc.\n\tIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept such proposals as may be recommended by staff, subject to the parties executing a final lease agreement in form satisfactory to the District and that any such agreement(s) be presented to the Board for ratification at the time of the next regular Board meeting.\n",

This Worksheet defines 13 individual bond funded projects that were presented in priority order for Board consideration. Consistent with the District’s Technology Plan, the singular goal of these 13 projects is to provide a 21st Century capacity for the instruction, administration, and support requirements of the District.\nIn the two years since Board approval, the Information Technology Department has diligently advanced the objectives of these 13 projects through acquisition and installation of material and equipment and the provision of related services. It is well understood that the rapid pace of change in technology makes it difficult to precisely predict technical details and costs of implementation for such a plan past a year or two. It has become increasingly apparent that many of the 13 projects are interconnected in ways that could not have been anticipated at the outset.\nAs a result, financial tracking and project management has become challenging. To help address this, it is proposed that the scope of the 13 projects be combined into 9 projects that are easier to administer. The attached presentation summarizes these changes and concludes with a “Revised Measure E Information Technology Budget”. Staff will be on hand to make a brief presentation and address any questions that may arise.\n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nMeasure E\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt the attached \"Revised Information Technology Budget for Measure E\" consistent with the District's Technology Plan.\n\t \n",
