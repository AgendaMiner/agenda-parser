The Perkins Act directs us to: (1) continuously upgrade and improve vocational career-technical education programs, (2) integrate academies with vocational education through a coherent sequence of courses to ensure learning in the core academic and technical subjects, (3) provide students with strong experience and understanding of all aspects of an industry, (4) develop, improve, or expand the use of technology in career technical education, (5) provide professional development to vocational teachers, administrators, and counselors, and (6) develop and implement evaluations of vocational and technical education programs carried out with Perkins funds, including assessment of how the needs of special populations are being met.Accomplishments:In our Local Plan/Application for the Perkins Act, each school site has identified and/or developed integrated career programs in the form of academies or magnet programs, identified and trained teacher teams, and continued with the integration of instruction through incorporation of core subject standards and relevancy activities.  We have also refined our Quality Criteria and Standards for Career-Technical Education programs, established career exploration and assessment activities, developed transition sequences to post secondary study, implemented skill certification programs, and developed a support academy for special education students.Our integrated career paths and academies are aligned with state career incentives.

At the request of the student’s parent or guardian, a school principal must submit to the local school governing board a request for a waiver of the requirement to pass the part(s) of the CAHSEE on which a modification was used and the equivalent of a passing score was earned.  For the local board to waive the CAHSEE requirement, the principal must certify to the local board that the pupil has all of the following:1)\tAn individualized education program adopted pursuant to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a plan adopted pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires the accommodations or modifications to be provided to the pupil when taking the high school exit examination.2)\tSufficient high school level coursework either satisfactorily completed or in progress in a high school level curriculum sufficient to have attained the skills and knowledge otherwise needed to pass the high school exit examination.3)\tAn individual score report for the pupil showing that the pupil has received the equivalent of a passing score on the high school exit examination while using a modification that fundamentally alters what the high school exit examination measures as determined by the State Board of Education.The waivers were requested by the school site administration on behalf of the students’ parents.The recommended waivers meet the aforementioned criteria delineated in Education Code Section 60851: Student A\tStudent B\tStudent C\tStudent D\tStudent E\tStudent FStudent G\tStudent H\tStudent I\tStudent J\tStudent K\tStudent LStudent M\tStudent N\tStudent O\tStudent P\tStudent Q\tStudent RStudent S FISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:NoneRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended waivers.
