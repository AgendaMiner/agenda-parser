Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nGlenn Vander Zee, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Kirsten King, Director of Assessment & Accountability, and Lucretia Peebles, Ph.D., Administrator for Charter School Oversight\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action of the East Side Union High School District’s Request to Amend the Term of the B. Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy\n\t \n1.   Brief Introduction and Summary of Recommendation\n\t \nOn August 22, 2013, the East Side Union High School district Board of Trustees (Board) conditionally approved the charter petition for Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy, granting the NHU Foundation (changed its name to The Foundation for Hispanic Education in January 2015) permission to operate the B. Roberto Cruz leadership Academy (BRCLA) within the boundaries of the East side Union High School District, located in San Jose, California for a term of two years, beginning on August 22, 2013, and ending on June 30, 2015.  The NHU Foundation did not open BRCLA in fall 2014 and, on August 21, 2014, sought the Board's approval of a material revision to the term of the charter to extend by one year (to fall 2015) its opening.  The Board approved the material revision request.  BRCLA opened on August 3, 2015, offering only the ninth grade.  The school will add a grade each year to reach its full complement of grades (9-12) and enrollment capacity of 400 students.  The current enrollment at BRCLA is 88 students.   BRCLA is located on the third floor of the former National Hispanic University.\n\t \nThe Board conditionally approved the charter petition for BRCLA based on the District Administration's concerns regarding \"[The NHU Foundations'] ability to implement the stated college preparatory program.\"  Moreover, the District Administration had \"questions and concerns\" regarding The NHU Foundation's ability to \"successfully implement the program set forth in the BRCLA petition....\" The Board's conditional approval included specific dates by which The NHU Foundation was to meet each condition.\n\t \nThe NHU Foundation met the Board-specified approval conditions for BRCLA within the agreed upon timeline.  During the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years.  District staff has monitored the Latino College Preparatory Academy program and noted not only that the educational program has improved, but also The NHU Foundation appears to be committed to offering a high quality educational program to students who attend its Latino College Preparatory Academy.  In May 2015, the Latino College Preparatory Academy was granted a \"Six-Year Accreditation Status (through June 30, 2021) by the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).  Luis Valdez Leadership Academy, opened by the NHU Foundation in August 2014, received initial accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Schools, WASC in April 2015, during its first year of operation.\n\t \nEducation Code § 47607 (a) (3) (A) establishes or sets forth as the most important criterion that a school board must consider in the renewal of a charter school, the school’s ability to show evidence of increased student achievement for all of its significant subgroups. BRCLA opened its doors on August 3, 2015, and cannot provide sufficient evidence to meet this criterion before the charter expiration date, June 30, 2016.\n\t \nThe District Administration requests that the Board amend the current term of the BRCLA charter by two years to provide BRCLA the full five-year term to collect student achievement data required by statute for renewal.    \n\t \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees review and consider the District Administration’s recommendation to amend the current three-year term of the B. Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy charter (to expire on June 30, 2016) to extend the charter by two years to end on June 30, 2018.\n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, April Chou, Director of Operations, KIPP Bay Area Schools, and Adam Kaye, Director of Real Estate\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action regarding Proposed Ground Lease Agreement with KIPP Bay Area Schools for Proposition 39 Charter School Facilities\n\t \n\t \nESUHSD is the chartering agency for KIPP San Jose Collegiate public charter school operated by KIPP: Bay Area Schools.  The KIPP charter school serves grade levels 9 – 12.\n\t \nEducation Code section 47614(b) provides in part: \n“Each school district shall make available, to each charter school operating in the school district, facilities sufficient for the charter school to accommodate all of the charter school’s in-district students in conditions reasonably equivalent to those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other public schools of the district.”\n\t \nThe implementing regulations for Section 47614 are contained in Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, section 11969.1 – 11969.11.  Section 11969.1(b) of the Regulations provides:\n“If a charter school and a school district mutually agree to an alternative to specific compliance with any of the provisions of this article, nothing in this article shall prohibit implementation of that alternative, including, for example, funding in lieu of facilities in an amount commensurate with local rental or lease costs for facilities reasonably equivalent to facilities of the district.”\n\t \nPursuant to Proposition 39 the District has provided facilities to KIPP pursuant to a Facilities Use Agreement for the period July 2013 through June 2017.  Pursuant to the Facilities Agreement KIPP currently pays approximately $103,000 annually in pro rata charges and excess space charges to the District for 24,960 square feet of improved existing classroom and office/administrative space and shared use of the District’s facilities and outdoor athletic facilities.\n\t \nKIPP has proposed to enter into a long term lease agreement with the District for approximately 2.40 acres (105,750 square feet) of land at the Independence High School site to meet KIPP San Jose Collegiate’s Prop. 39 facilities needs on a long term basis.  Under such an arrangement KIPP would construct its own school facilities on the land for use as KIPP’s charter school facilities.  \n\t \nThe District and KIPP have been working towards and have made substantial progress on a formal written agreement for consideration and approval by the Board.  The material terms of the proposed agreement include the following:\nA 180 day contingency period from the date of execution of the lease during which time KIPP shall satisfy itself that: (i) it can obtain financing for construction of facilities for its public charter school site on the site, (ii) the physical, environmental, and legal condition of the property, as well as all other related factors, are satisfactory to KIPP and make it feasible for KIPP to construct its project on the property and organize and operate its school there; and (iii) that all approvals required by any governmental entity with jurisdiction needed in KIPP’s judgment to allow KIPP to construct the facility and utilize it for its school have been obtained.\nKIPP would construct a school facility of approximately 40,000 – 60,000 square feet on the site for KIPP’s grade 9-12 program which would include approximately 30 classrooms for core academic classes including science labs and special education rooms, 5 enrichment spaces, including art rooms, and a media center/library, a gymnasium, and ancillary administration and faculty offices, student services and custodial spaces and related site improvements and utility installations.  KIPP shall pay and be responsible for all costs of construction and shall agree to abide by the Project Labor Agreement.\nThe District will continue to share outdoor athletic facilities (e.g., fields, track, hard court surfaces, etc.) with KIPP for KIPP’s physical education classes/program.\nThe use of the premises and facilities would be limited to a public charter high school serving grades 9-12, with an enrollment cap of 800, but up to 840 students on a limited basis.  KIPP’s in-district ADA shall comprise not less than 51% of its total classroom ADA.\nThe facilities design and construction shall be to the same building and safety standards for public classroom facilities and will be subject to review and approval of the Division of the State Architect (DSA).\nThe agreement would be for a term of thirty (30) years with three options to renew the term for 5 years each (total possible lease term of 45 years).\nKIPP shall pay rent to the District of $1.00 per square foot per year (approx. $105,750 per year) in lieu of its pro rata facilities share under Prop. 39 and KIPP shall pay its own utilities and operating expenses and shall be responsible for maintaining and repairing the facility and improvements.\nKIPP shall commence paying rent under the lease on the earlier of: (i) the date that KIPP substantially completes construction of its facility improvements and is using the improvements; or (ii) July 1, 2018.\nRent shall be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index every five years after the rent commencement, provided that any CPI increase shall be no less than 3% and no greater than 10%. \nThe District will provide temporary housing to KIPP on the Independence site during the construction period, subject to the terms of the Facilities Use Agreement.\nSo long as the lease is in effect KIPP will not seek or have the right to obtain additional facilities from the District pursuant to Proposition 39 for KIPP San Jose Collegiate charter school.\nKIPP may pledge its interest in the lease as security for financing for the construction and equipping of its facilities, but shall not encumber the District’s title interest in the Independence High School site.\nAt the end of the lease term title in all facilities built by KIPP will vest in the District.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nRental per the Lease Terms\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees consider and approve the Lease Agreement with KIPP for Proposition 39 charter school facilities in substantially the form presented.\n\t \n",

School employees: sick leave: paternity and maternity leave\n\t \nUnder existing law, when a certificated school employee exhausts all available sick leave, as specified, and continues to be absent from his or her duties on account of illness or accident for an additional period of up to 5 school months, the employee during that additional period receives the difference between his or her salary and the sum that is actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill his or her position during his or her absence or, if no substitute employee was employed, the amount that would have been paid to the substitute had he or she been employed. This bill would additionally provide the differential pay benefit described above for up to 12 weeks if the certificated school employee is absent on account of maternity or paternity leave, as defined, as specified. \n\t \nThe bill would provide that the 12-week period shall be reduced by any period of sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, during a period of maternity or paternity leave. The bill would prohibit a certificated school employee on maternity or paternity leave pursuant to the Moore-Brown-Roberti Family Rights Act from being denied access to differential pay while on that leave. The bill would provide that, to the extent these provisions conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement entered into before January 1, 2016, by a public school employer and an exclusive bargaining representative, these provisions shall not apply until the expiration or renewal of that collective bargaining agreement.\n\t \nEast Side Union High School District - Current Practice:\nFMLA – Family Medical Leave Act\nCFRA – California Family Rights Act\n\t \nESUHSD and ESTA are currently in a three-year agreement that ends in 2018.  Our current CBA language allows for employees to use their sick leave for maternity followed by up to 12 weeks of FMLA/CFRA for child rearing and bonding after the birth of the child.  Baby bonding must be used in the 12 months after the birth, adoption or placement of the child.  Both fathers and mothers are eligible to use 12 weeks of FMLA/CFRA for baby bonding. \n\t \nEmployers are not required to pay employees during a FMLA/CFRA leave.  An employer may require an employee to use accrued vacation time or other accumulated paid leave other than sick time. The ESUHSD allows certificated employees to elect to use sick time.  The employee continues to have medical benefits during the leave.  When an employee uses up his/her sick leave, the remaining portion of his/her 12 weeks for child rearing and bonding are without pay.\n\t \n\t \nPossible Change in Board Policy Effective January 1, 2016\nA change in Board policy to conform to AB375 would entitle certificated employees on leave for baby bonding,  to sub differential pay after they had exhausted all accumulated sick leave.  Sub differential pay is the difference between his/her salary and the sum that is paid to a substitute or the amount that would have been paid to a substitute had he or she been employed.\n\t \nIn 2013-14:\n\t \nCertificated Employees\nFMLA/CFRA  Paid – Sick Leave       -           235.37 Days\nFMLA UNPAID                                  -           175.15 Days\n\t \nIn 2014-15\nFMLA/CFRA  Paid – Sick Leave       -           264.15 Days\nFMLA UNPAID                                   -           170.29 Days\n\t \n\t \nCertificated Employees\n\t \nThe difference in salary between an employee on UNPAID status for 12 weeks and sub-differential would be approximately $200 per day.  This estimate is based on an average salary of $ 65K and long term substitute pay of $155/day.  Cost would vary based on the salary of the certificated employee on leave.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAs stipulated by the Board of Trustees.\n",
