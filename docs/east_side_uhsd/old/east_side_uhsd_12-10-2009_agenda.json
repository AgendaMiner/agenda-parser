Through the Federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Federal State Fiscal Stabilization Funds we have been able to offset drastic State Education Funding cuts retaining jobs and continue educating our students.  That having been said the projections for the subsequent years are more than bleak.  The 2009-2010 First Interim Financial Report projection next school year 2010-2011 shows the District will be able to meet its financial obligations but short by $6.4 million in State required unrestricted reserves.  In the 2011-2012 school year the projection indicates the District will be $12.7 million short in meeting its financial obligations.  Current State requirements obligate local school boards to certify the financial condition of the school district into one of three conditions which are:POSITIVE CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district will be able meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years.QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years.NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION - …based upon current projections this district will be unable to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year or for the remainder of the fiscal year or for the subsequent fiscal year.What the attached 2009-2010 First Interim Financial Report shows is that the District will be able to meet its financial obligations and reserve requirements for the current fiscal year plus meet the financial obligations but not the reserve requirement for the immediate subsequent year.  The report does project that the District may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.  RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that given the current financial projections the Board of Trustees approve a Qualified Certification of the 2009-2010 First Interim Financial Report.  \n",
