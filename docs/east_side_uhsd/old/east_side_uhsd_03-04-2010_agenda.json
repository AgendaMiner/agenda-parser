As such, ARRA funds were subject to the rules and regulations that govern Title I. These regulations included the required 20% set aside for Supplemental Education Services (SES) as well as the required 10% for Professional Development. This is above and beyond the amounts already being set aside for these activities from the “regular” Title I funds received. Many Local Education Agencies (LEA – school districts) were concerned that this additional set aside will not provide the flexibility needed in this fiscal climate.  Consequently, the California Department of Education (CDE) and the State Board of Education (SBE) jointly submitted eight waiver requests to the United States Department of Education (ED). East Side Union High School District is submitting an ARRA waiver and plan to the State Board of Education (SBE) to achieve more flexibility in expending our ARRA funds.FISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:Title I Part AARRA FundRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the 2010 ARRA Waiver Application and Plan as indicated herein, and that the Interim Superintendent be authorized to make modifications as needed.
