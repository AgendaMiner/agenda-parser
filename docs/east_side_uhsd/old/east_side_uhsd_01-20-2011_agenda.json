This base line will allow East Side to obtain modernization grants based on this base line enrollment number.\n\t \nThe Calero campus will house a continuation high school, the Post Senior Program for disabled students, and a modified independent study program.\n\t \nThe projected number of students eligible for the Post Senior Program for the 2012-13 school year is 180 with 172 qualifying as severely disabled and 8 non-severely disabled. The actual classroom capacity for the Post Senior Program at Calero is 108. The plan is to implement a rotating community--based program for these students so that the population rotates through the facility and community--based activities, thus doubling the usage of the existing space.\nThe projected enrollment for the continuation high school is 260 students. This aligns with the number of rooms and a class size requirement for continuation high schools of 26.  Currently, the district has a greater need for alternative education programs for its current student population and it is anticipated that the continuation high school on the Calero campus will operate at full capacity.\nThe projected enrollment for the modified independent study program is 60 which is based on two sessions of 30 students rotating through the facility each day. This will provide a need for an existing population of students who would benefit from being placed into this type of alternative setting.\n\t \n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nN/A\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nN/A\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAccept Update for Calero High School.\n",
