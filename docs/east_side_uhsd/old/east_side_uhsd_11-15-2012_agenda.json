In a year in which a regular election for governing board members is conducted, the meeting shall be held on a day within a 15-day period that commences with the date upon which a governing board member elected at that election takes office.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\t \nThe Board’s Organizational and next Regular Meeting is currently scheduled for Thursday, December 6, 2012.  However, Education Code section 5017 provides:\n\t \n\"Each person elected at a regular biennial governing board member election shall hold office for a term of four years commencing on the first Friday in December next succeeding his or her election.  Any member of the governing board of a school district or community college district whose term has expired shall continue to discharge the duties of the office until his or her successor has qualified. The term of the successor shall begin upon the expiration of the term of his or her predecessor.\" (emphasis added.)\n\t \nMagdalena Carrasco has been elected to the ESUHSD Board.  In this case, the first Friday in December is December 7, which is the commencement of her four year term.  However, the Board’s organizational meeting is currently scheduled for the day before, December 6, on a date when Ms. Carrasco is not yet qualified to hold office or participate in the Board meeting.    \n\t \nThus, because the Organizational Meeting cannot take place without Ms. Carrasco’s involvement (Educ. Code 35143), it will have to be rescheduled to a date when she is qualified to hold office and within 15 days after Ms. Carrasco takes office.\n\t \n\t \nRecommendation:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees amend the 2012 Annual Organizational and Regular Board Meeting Calendar as stipulated by the Board of Trustees to a date in December on which Ms. Carrasco can participate as a seated and sworn Board member.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
