Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities\n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Determine the Design Build Delivery for the Fire Alarm Upgrade Project will Reduce Project Costs, Expedite the Project's Completion or Provide Features Not Achievable Through the Design Bid Build Process\n\t \nOn February 14, 2013, the Board considered public works construction project delivery methods, including design-bid-build, design-build, energy service contracting, and lease lease-back.  On June 11, 2013, the Board of Trustees authorized expenditure of Measure I funds for infrastructure projects.\n\t \nA Fire Alarm System Condition Study commissioned in 2014 found that fire alarm systems districtwide are in need of modernization.  The age and condition of the systems range from site to site.  Sites such as Calero and Overfelt Adult Center have systems whose panels, wiring and devices are newer.  Other sites have aged systems whose components are in fair to poor condition.  As individual buildings at those sites are modernized and new buildings constructed, current building codes mandate fire alarm system functionality that our existing systems do not have. The Study recommends replacement in whole or in part of site fire alarm systems, to support the demands of the modernization program code requirements, as well as mitigate the increasing annual repair and maintenance cost of the existing systems. \n\t \nDistrict and bond program management staff examined possible construction delivery methods, and have concluded that the use of design-build delivery for the project offers the following potential advantages to the District not available under a traditional design-bid-build delivery method:\n\t \nSimplified contracting and contract administration:  There is one contract with the design-build entity instead of separate contracts with an engineer and a contractor.   This reduces administrative burden and associated costs.\nCost containment:  The design-build entity is under a contract to complete the project meeting the District’s stated requirements within the contract price.\nCost savings:  Innovative, cost-effective solutions meeting performance criteria can be achieved by collaboration between the designer and builder, adding construction practicality to design imagination.  The builder is involved in the design process from the beginning and can provide helpful insights on construction materials and methods that can make the design more efficient and less costly to construct, operate and maintain. \nEarly cost definition:  Project costs are determined much sooner than with the traditional design-bid-build process.   The design-build method enables the District to determine the cost of the project upon award of the design-build contract instead of after Division of the State Engineer approval and construction contract bidding.   This early cost knowledge allows the District to make informed decisions on detailed scope in order to ensure equity of outcomes among the school sites.\nReduced number of change orders and disputes:  Because the designer and builder are part of the same design-build entity, and the District is not the guarantor of the completeness and accuracy of the work of the engineer, the District may avoid conflicts and disputes, and the corresponding costs of those conflicts and disputes that can arise between the engineer and construction contractor.\nGreater risk shifting and more efficient risk allocation:  The vesting of design and construction functions under one entity enables proper allocation of risk under the design-build contract, because the contractor’s involvement in constructability review and existing site condition surveys during preconstruction activities reduces or eliminates the need for redesign during the construction phase. \nReduction in adversarial relationships:  The designer and builder are teamed together, working under a single contract.  This teaming can significantly reduce traditional conflicts and finger-pointing between designer and contractor, and eliminate the need for the District to referee disputes.\nTime savings:  The design-build entity is allowed the freedom to explore time-saving construction methods or systems while meeting the District’s stated criteria.  Early coordination between the designer and builder can help prevent construction delays.   Additionally, by overlapping design and construction to some extent, design-build can deliver the project faster than the design-bid-build approach.  Any and all of these elements can accelerate delivery of modernized fire alarm systems.\nAlternative selection process: Design-build entities may be selected on the basis of factors other than price alone.  Design-build entities can assemble a team of engineers, architects, subcontractors and suppliers with whom they have had previous successful collaborations, and that reflect the goals and needs of the project.  The District can select the winning team based on not only price, but also other factors including technical expertise, life cycle cost over 15 years or more, skilled labor force availability, safety record, successful previous experience, project-specific plans and schedules, design, and other qualitative elements.\n\t \nEducation Code §17250.20 stipulates that upon making a determination by the governing board that it is in the best interest of the District, the Board may enter into a design-build contract for both the design and construction of a school facility if that expenditure exceeds two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) if, after evaluation of the traditional design, bid, and build process of school construction and of the design-build process in a public meeting, the governing board makes written findings that use of the design-build process on the specific project under consideration will accomplish one of the following objectives:  reduce comparable project costs, expedite the project's completion, or provide features not achievable through the traditional design-bid-build method.  The governing board also shall review the guidelines developed pursuant to Education Code §17250.40 (Attachment A) and shall adopt a resolution approving the use of a design-build contract pursuant to this chapter prior to entering into a design-build contract.\n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of
