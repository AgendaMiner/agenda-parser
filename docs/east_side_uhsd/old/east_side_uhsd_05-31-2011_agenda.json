Overfelt and Yerba Buena High Schools, Kitchen Renovation Projects (Calstate Construction, Inc.)\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nAt the April 15, 2010 Board meeting, Facilities and Planning submitted a change order for the subject project showing the reconciliation of the contracted bid amount including the 10% allowance.  However, at that time there was still one outstanding issue that needed to be resolved with the General Contractor.  It was not until recently did the General Contractor and ESUHSD reach settlement on the unresolved issue.  This amended change order is being submitted to the Board for approval. However, the total amount of this change does not exceed the amount on the purchasing order but does require Board approval so that Administration can move money from a closed purchase order to pay the additional settled amount of $4,000.00. The amended change is highlighted in red.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nAs indicated in the attachment\n\t\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nAs indicated in the attachment\n\t\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the amended change #1 for W.C.
