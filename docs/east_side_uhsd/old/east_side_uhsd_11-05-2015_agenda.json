Overfelt, and Yerba Buena High Schools\n\t \n\t \n\t \nOn September 25, 2014 (Board Item 5.05), Administration presented a proposed concept space plan for alternative education facilities district-wide.  The goals of the plan were to provide long-term housing for charter schools, accommodate Post Senior Program growth, provide new facilities at Independence Adult Education Center (IAC) for Pegasus High School, and mitigate impacts at IAC through modernization of existing Building 100 for administrative space, and development of joint use facilities with Pegasus at the IAC site. \n\t \nAt the October 15, 2015, Board meeting (Board Item 15.02), the Board directed Administration to develop a plan that does not encumber the IAC with any non-Adult Education program.  Administration has developed a revised plan that does not encroach upon IAC, by providing facilities for Pegasus and County Office of Education programs at Independence High School; this revised plan is delineated in the presentation to the Board.\n\t \nSince September 2014, progress has been made on various components of the proposed plan in order to prepare instructional and administrative space for charter schools, including development of temporary housing at Independence High School, and preparation of existing space for incoming charter schools at Oak Grove and W.C. Overfelt High Schools.  This agenda item specifies the current financial status of each of the components of the proposed plan, the funding sources associated with each component of the plan, and requests Board approval of the plan and/or its component parts. \n\t \nA financial status through October 26, 2015, is presented here, with additional detail in the accompanying presentation:\nSite\nContract Commitments\nExpenditures\nUnbilled Liability\nCommitted Funding Source(s)\nIndependence Portable Village (temporary housing)\n$1,252,326.42\n$732,222.54\n$520,103.88\nMeasure E (Board/Cabinet Contingency)\nMeasure E KIPP Allocation\nMeasure I KIPP Allocation\nOak Grove\n$426,194.19\n$147,596.24\n$278,597.95\n\t\t\t\t\t \nMeasure E (Board/Cabinet Contingency)\nW.C.

This tax is informally known as the “Cadillac Tax” and will impose a penalty on employers, health insurers and “persons who administer plan benefits” with regard to high-cost health care coverage. The purpose of the Excise Tax is threefold: (1) to help fund the costs of the ACA, (2) to assist with slowing the rate of growth of health care costs, and (3) to address the unequal tax treatment of employer-sponsored health coverage. \n\t \nThe Excise Tax applies to fully insured and self-funded plans for both active employees and retirees. For fully insured plans, the insurer will pay the tax on its share of the “excess benefit.” Although there is no requirement for insurers to pass on the cost of the tax to employers, it is certainly expected that they will do so.  Although the Excise Tax is not effective until 2018, it is critical for East Side to address the potential impact to its benefits programs. The presentation will provide context, strategies, and timelines to mitigate the impact of the tax on East Side. \n\t \n\t \n",
