The cost of operating the District’s Food Service Program has outpaced the amount of revenues available and has resulted in a number of program challenges.    \n\t\t \nThe changes proposed to the Food Service Program at East Side Union High School District are being recommended to address these challenges.  In the fiscal year ending 2012-13, the Program lost $213,000 and is projected to lose another $179,000 by the end of the current fiscal year ending June 30, 2014.  At the end of the current fiscal year, the food service reserve fund is expected to have a balance of $181,000 and is expected to be fully depleted by June 30, 2015, if no action is taken.  If the food service reserve fund becomes fully depleted, the Program will have to be supplemented by the District’s general fund if losses continue.  This situation is commonly referred to as encroachment and will result in less money being available to support sites, staffing and academic programs.       \n\t\t \nThe District is offering the following three recommendations in order to address this situation:  \n\t\t \nRecommendation #1 – Implement a meal price increase:\nEffective July 1 - Fiscal Year 2014-15\nPaid Breakfast – Increase by $.25 from $1.50 to $1.75\nPaid Lunch – Remain the same at $3.00\nPaid Adult Lunch – Increase by $.25 from $3.50 to $3.75\nIn comparison to eight local districts surveyed, East Side ranks the lowest in breakfast pricing and it was also determined that our current free and reduced pricing is actually supporting the Paid Breakfast pricing.  This is a situation that definitely should not occur and is actually in violation of the National School Lunch Act if this had been the case with the District’s lunch program.  As a result, the District is recommending a $.25 increase to Paid Breakfast pricing.  In regard to the student lunch program, East Side’s pricing is on average with the comparison group of school districts.  As a side note, East Side’s pricing is $.25 less than San Jose Unified School District.  The District is not recommending any increase in student lunch pricing at this time.  The District is recommending a $.25 increase to Paid Adult Lunches.  The District’s Paid Adult Lunch pricing ranks at the bottom of the survey group.  It is estimated that the proposed changes to Paid Breakfast and Adult Lunch pricing will result in an increase of $7,436 in ongoing revenue.   \n\t\t \nRecommendation #2 – Eliminate charging for Reduced Price Meals:\nFederal eligibility requirements for reduced price lunch are the same in San Jose, California as it is in Bismark, North Dakota; however, the costs of living in San Jose is 50% higher.  We don’t believe this situation is equitable or fair to the students and parents who are eligible for reduced priced meals at East Side Union High School District.  There have been several other Northern California school districts which have taken this same position to eliminate reduced pricing, which are Morgan Hill Unified and Sacramento City Unified.  East Side would be the largest district in the Bay Area to take this position on behalf of lower income parents and students.  The current eligibility criteria for reduced priced meal is as follows: \n\t\t \nReduced Priced Meal Eligibility Criteria for the 48 contiguous States\nHousehold Size\nFederal Poverty Guidelines (Annual)\nAnnually\nMonthly\nTwice Per Month\nEvery Two Weeks\nWeekly\n1\n11,670\n21,590\n1,800\n900\n831\n416\n2\n15,730\n29,101\n2,426\n1,213\n1,120\n560\n3\n19,790\n36,612\n3,051\n1,526\n1,409\n705\n4\n23,850\n44,123\n3,677\n1,839\n1,698\n849\n5\n27,910\n51,634\n4,303\n2,152\n1,986\n993\n6\n31,970\n59,145\n4,929\n2,465\n2,275\n1,138\n7\n36,030\n66,656\n5,555\n2,778\n2,564\n1,282\n8\n40,090\n74,167\n6,181\n3,091\n2,853\n1,427\n\t\t \nThe District currently has 2,954 approved applications on file for reduced priced eligible students.  The current pricing for reduced priced breakfast is $.30 and $.40 for lunch.  The District estimates that it will cost $130,914 to cover the lost revenue.  The National School Lunch Program funding is not allowed to cover the reduced price revenue loss – the loss revenue must be paid from another source and we plan to utilize vending revenue to cover the shortfall.  \n\t\t \nRationale to Support this Recommendation \nBased on our research and information from districts which have already eliminated reduced pricing, they have experienced exponential increases in breakfast and lunch participation. It was reported in a local Sacramento Newspaper that “A local district experiencing budget cuts re-imposed reduced price charges after years of not charging students for reduced price meals. The district found after a year's trial that fewer students were eating breakfast and lunch and that total revenues decreased. The following year, the reduced price charges were eliminated and they had a noticeable increase in participation and total revenue increased”. (Rosemont, CA Patch, May 7, 2013)\n\t\t \nThe District believes that, if reduced pricing is eliminated, overall free breakfast and lunch participation will increase at the same % of current free lunch participation Districtwide. Current free breakfast and lunch program participation are at 25.8% and 38.8%, respectively.   The District projects that the increased participation for reduced price elimination would result in increased (State & Federal) reimbursements totaling $129,622 for breakfast and $207,969 for lunch.  The increase in reimbursement revenues is projected to total $337,591.  The total projected net revenue gain to the District is $206,677 ($337,591 - $130,914).   \n\t\t \nThe District believes this approach is a game changer in regard to our approach in delivering our program to lower income families.  We believe this is truly a \"win, win, win\" for our students, parents and the District and will enable East Side to not only meet the needs of lower income families, but to also increase participation and bolster revenues.    \n\t\t \nRecommendation #3 – Implement  an After-School Supper Program:\nCurrently, the District’s Child Nutrition Program supports seven after school programs throughout the District as part of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).  The NSLP program allows the District to provide an after school snack to District eligible students consisting of pretzels and orange juice, muffin and milk, or graham crackers and milk.  In return for providing the snacks to eligible students, the NSLP provides a reimbursement to the District.  For fiscal year 2013-14, the reimbursement amount is estimated at $205,800.  In fiscal year 2014-15, the District is planning to increase the number of after school programs offered, such as Gear Up, California Community Partners for Youth (CCPY), and Goodwill.  It is anticipated that hundreds of more students will participate in these very vital programs.  \n\t\t \nThe District is requesting the Board’s consideration to replace the snack program with a Supper Program, which is sponsored by the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and will provide students with a full supper, including a meat/meat alternative, grain, fruit, vegetable, and milk.  The Program provides a higher District reimbursement and allows sites with 50% or more free and reduced eligible students to offer meals for free to all students, regardless of their meal status.  The program does not require students to show ID and would be available to all students participating in after-school programs.      \n\t\t \nIn order to support this initiative, the District would need to hire at least 16 new 4.75 FTEs.  The District is projecting to be reimbursed for at least 1,815 meals per day, which would generate a total reimbursable income of $860,991 under the CACFP.  The projected cost for the increased meals and labor costs would total an estimated $556,305.  The increase in reimbursement revenues is projected to total $304,686.  The total projected net revenue gain to the District is $98,886 ($304,686 - $205,800).   \n\t\t \nFiscal Impact: \n\t\t \nMeal Price Increase                                                                $7,436\nElimination of Reduced Meal Price                                     $206,677\nNew Supper Program                                                           $98,886\nTotal Anticipated Revenue “Swing” (Fund 61)              $312,999\n\t\t \nFunding Source: \nAll recommendations are self-funded and do not require earmarked funds from the general fund or the Child Nutrition Service Fund (Fund 61).\n\t\t \nRecommendations:  \nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the District’s recommendation #1; to implement a meal price increase of $.25 for Paid Breakfast and $.25 for Adult Lunch effective, July 1, 2014; and eliminate reduced meal price charge; and lastly, to offer an after-school Supper Program as part of the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP); and authorize the hiring of up to 16 new 4.75 FTEs to support the Program.  \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, André Bell, Assistant Director of Capital Accounting and Purchasing, and Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager\n\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nDiscussion and/or Action to Award a Lease/Lease Back Pre-Construction Agreement for Independence High School Performing Arts Center – Building F Modernization\n\t \nBackground\nOn February 14, 2013 (Item 8.07), the Board of Trustees received a presentation on Alternative Public Works Construction Delivery Methods.   On October 17, 2013 (Item 15.01), the Board received a presentation on utilizing the Lease/Leaseback Delivery Method for Modernization Projects at Independence High School.  Staff continued to analyze the benefits of using the Lease/Leaseback Delivery method for the Modernization Projects at Independence High School and proceeded with the development based on the rational that this delivery method is ideal for complex projects with multiple scopes. This method would provide fewer change orders due to a pre-construction agreement, greater price certainty as the contractor offers a guaranteed maximum price (GMP), team collaboration to identify a fair scope within the budget and early involvement of contractor adds construction practicality to design imagination are some of the reasons staff determined this was the proper method to use.\n\t \nDevelopment of Lease/Leaseback Request for Qualifications and Proposals (RFQ/P)\nThe Request for Qualifications and Proposals (RFQ/P) was developed by Facilities and Capital Purchasing staff, in conjunction with the construction manager for the project, Van Pelt Construction Services. The RFQ/P was seeking Lease/Leaseback Developers who are experienced in the construction of public school facilities in Northern California, and are experienced with the lease/leaseback method of project delivery to provide to the District pre-construction services, project cost estimates, design constructability review, value engineering and construction services.\n\t \nThe RFQ/P specified that the following selection criteria were to be considered in determining best value and selecting the most qualified LLB whose proposal provides comprehensive pre-construction and construction services at a competitive price with the highest quality:\n\t \n1.\nCommunication Plan\n   5 points\n2.\nProposed Team\n 10 points\n3.\nEducational Projects Experience\n 10 points\n4.\nCompleteness and Quality of SOQ\n   5 points\n5.\nPrice and Fees\n 30 points\n6.\nProject Execution Plan\n 20 points\n7.\nUse of Local Subcontractors\n  5 points\n8.\nDSA, LLB Experience\n 15 points\nTotal (Maximum)\n100 points\n                                   \nIssuance of Request for Proposals\nThe RFQ/P (RFQ/P-15-13-14) was issued on March 11, 2014, to the District’s Prequalified Contractors as well as plan rooms, and posted on the District’s website, pursuant to the Authority of Education Code §17406. A mandatory Pre-Submittal Conference was held on March 18, 2014.  Eleven Developers and one Subcontractor attended the Pre-Submittal Conference.\n\t \nReceipt of Proposals from Lease Leaseback Developers\nOn April 7, 2014, the District received seven Statements of Qualifications (SOQ) from McCarthy Building Companies, Inc., Blach Construction Company, Turner Construction Company, Jeff Luchetti Construction Company, Alten Construction Company, XL Construction, and Overaa Construction.\n\t \nProposal Evaluation Process\nAll submitted proposals underwent an in-depth technical review by construction management staff. The purpose of this review was to score each Developer’s proposal based on the criteria outlined in the RFQ/P. Capital Purchasing and Facilities staff reviewed and accepted the evaluation scores.  The intent was to invite the top three scoring Developers to interview. All Developers that submitted SOQs were well qualified; four SOQs were most responsive to the RFQ/P:  Turner Construction Company, XL Construction, Overaa Construction and McCarthy Building Companies, Inc.  The third place score was tied, so staff elected to interview four teams in lieu of allowing the tie to prejudice either Developer.  The top four teams each scored 87% or higher. \n\t \nInterview Process\nThe four highest scoring Developers from the proposal review process were invited to interview on April 14, 2014.  On that day, each Developer was given a 45-minute time slot.  15 minutes were allotted for an initial presentation, then 30 minutes for questions/answers. The interview panel was comprised of the Independence High School Principal, Capital Purchasing and Facilities Planning staff, Van Pelt Construction Services construction management team, and the project Architect of Record staff.\n\t \nConclusions and Next Steps\nThe panel deliberated extensively after the interviews.  While the panel was impressed with each of the four Developers, and commented that any one of them could provide excellent delivery of this project, the panel ranked the teams as follows:\n\t \nLLB Developer\nRank\nMcCarthy Building Companies, Inc.\n1\nOveraa Construction\n2\nXL Construction\n2\nTurner Construction\n4\n\t \n\t \nThrough a Pre-Construction Services Agreement, McCarthy will provide design constructability review, value engineering recommendations, cost estimating and scheduling.  This will lead to McCarthy providing a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the modernization to the Performing Arts Center, Building F at Independence High School.  Once the District receives the GMP, at which time District administration will bring forth to the Board a recommendation to award Lease/Leaseback Site Lease and Facilities Lease Agreements.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:                                                    \nNot to Exceed $75,000\n                       \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nGeneral Obligation Bond Measure E\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:       \nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees award a Lease/Leaseback Pre-Construction Services Agreement to McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. for the Independence High School Performing Arts Center - Building F Modernization project in an amount not to exceed $75,000.\n",
