These Lease Agreements did not contain any buy-out clause and was therefore a straight lease arrangement from year to year. \n\t\t \nDistrict administration performed a cost benefit analysis of these lease agreements and determined that continued lease of these portables will not be in the best financial welfare of the district. It was further determined that these relocatable classrooms are still needed and school site administrators confirmed that due to the space and educational requirements of their respective sites, these relocatables are projected to be used in the future without a definitive date of removal. \n\t\t \nThese relocatable classrooms were first placed in service between 1989 and 2005.  In our financial analysis, continued lease of these portables for the next five years will cost the district $1,823,971.80.   However, the district can opt to purchase these relocatable classrooms now for a negotiated total one time cost of $1,385,688.93.  This action will save the district $438,282.87  in the next five years.  \n\t\t \nIn addition, there are twenty eight more relocatable classrooms that falls under a previous Lease-Purchase Agreements with insufficient fund balances to fulfill our contract obligations. Administration recommends approving a purchase order of $100,215.45 to cover the remaining balance of the contract which will effectively complete the agreement and ownership of those relocatable classrooms will belong to the district. \n\t\t \nDistrict administration is attaching the report that supports our cost benefit analysis.  \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$1,485,904.38\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\n$1,385,688.93 - Capital Facilities (Developer Fees)\n$  100,215.45 - Measure G\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the purchase of seventy (70) relocatable classrooms from Mobile Modular, Inc. and Williams Scotsman, Inc. listed on the attached report.

Currently, there are one hundred and eight leased relocatable classrooms throughout the District.  \n\t\t\t \nWhile several of these relocatable classrooms are being recommended for purchase, there are several that will need to be kept on a lease agreement as it is economically advantageous for the District since removal of those relocatables will take place.  However, there are outstanding invoices that need to be paid to bring these relocatable classroom accounts current.\n\t\t\t \nThe fourteen (14) relocatable classrooms at Mt. Pleasant High School will continue to be leased until the classroom modernization projects are completed.  Removal will follow thereafter.  Twenty-four (24) relocatable classrooms at Oak Grove High School will be leased for an additional one year term while the District administration and school principal further determine the necessity of their continued use.  \n\t\t\t \nApproval of leases and/or rental agreements for relocatables classrooms housed at various school sites according to the attached spreadsheet is requested so that the District can continue to pay past and current invoices.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$524,663.58\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nCapital Facilities (Developer Fees)\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the continued lease/rental of these relocatable classrooms located at various District schools according to the attached report.\n",
