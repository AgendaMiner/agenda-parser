Overfelt High School campus, and its current facility use agreement with the District expires June 30, 2016.  Alpha, like most of the District’s charter schools, is allocated facilities on a yearly basis by the District. \n\t \nAfter consideration of Alpha’s request Administration proposes to enter into a one-year (2016-2017) agreement for continued Prop. 39 facilities for Alpha at the Overfelt High School site.  Unlike the Summit Rainier, Summit Tahoma, ACE and DCP charter schools, the Administration proposes a one (1) year facility use agreement for Alpha because Alpha’s future enrollment is expected to exceed current facilities and space availability at the current location.  The agreement is conditioned upon Alpha maintaining its charter in good standing and Alpha continuing to pay its pro rata share of facilities costs as authorized by Prop. 39.  The facilities include both “Dedicated Space” (classroom and administrative facilities for Alpha’s exclusive use in connection with its education program) and equitable shared use of other site facilities (including, for example, gyms, multi-purpose room, theatre, parking, athletic fields) to be used in connection with Alpha’s academic and athletic program, and for no other purpose.\n\t \nThe Administration requests authority to negotiate and enter into a Facilities Use Agreement with Alpha for a one (1) year term in accordance with the District’s form Facilities Use Agreement (copy attached) subject to subsequent ratification by the Board.\n\t \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nTo be determined. \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize Administration to negotiate and enter into a Facilities Use Agreement for charter school facilities with Alpha for a one (1) year term at the W.C. Overfelt High School site in accordance with with the District's form Facilities Use Agreement and subject to subsequent ratification by the Board. \n",

Many members of the public are not aware of Senate Bill 277’s effect as it relates to the mandatory exclusion of children from school unless the  exemption is made for medical reasons.  \n\t \nThe California Legislature should amend Senate Bill 277 to extend the deadline to file personal beliefs exemptions to July 1, 2016, to make the effective date and operative date of Senate Bill 277 consistent and transparent to the public.  The attached resolution urges the California Legislature to amend State Senate Bill 277 to extend the deadline for filing exemptions for personal beliefs to July 1, 2016.  Furthermore, East Side Union High School District requests that the staff of the Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools work with the Legislature and the State Board of Trustees to extend the deadline for filing personal beliefs exemptions to July 1, 2016. \n\t \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees Adopt Resolution #2015/2016-14 Urging the Legislature to Extend the Personal Beliefs Exemption Deadline to July 1, 2016.\n\t \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, and Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nReceive Update on Independence High School's Growth Impacts and Mitigations \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nOn February 4, 2016 (Board Item 8.05), the Board received a presentation on impacts of charter schools on Independence High School’s facilities.  The Board approved long and short term upgrades to mitigate those impacts, and requested updates on the following items.\n\t\t\t \nIndependence High School Athletic Facilities\nThe approved new practice infield and batting cages will be welcomed additions to the softball and baseball facilities, allowing more teams to practice concurrently. Baseball Coach Bob Leadbetter proposed the idea, and even mocked up a recommended location near the sand volleyball court with painted line markings, bases and pitching mounds.  The field could be dirt, and serve as both softball and baseball infields.  With the closely mown grass and painted markings, the area is already providing additional practice space for concurrent use with the existing two softball and two baseball fields.  The painted mock up demonstrates that a practice infield will fit – a concern voiced by Physical Education (PE) staff.  The mock up also demonstrates that there remains space for new batting cages behind home plate.  There is also space at the east end of the natural turf athletic zone for batting cages.  Independence High School staff will be highly engaged with the design of these new facilities, to ensure that the needs of PE, men’s and women’s athletics are optimized.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nAnother concern voiced at the February 4, Board meeting was that the soccer field layout is not as shown on the presentation.  The graphic showed two side by side soccer fields, parallel to each other and perpendicular to Mabury Avenue.  That layout is the optimized layout designed when the field was renovated in 2013; there are permanent markers at the corners of each field to facilitate repainting of line markings at the beginning of each soccer season.  Last year, one field was marked in differently just for the 2015 soccer season to accommodate storm drainage improvements that were underway.  Those storm drain improvements have been installed, and future soccer field layout will return to the optimized one indicated on the presented graphic.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nIndependence High School Staff Restrooms Near Building K3\nThe availability of staff restrooms near Building K3 Science Classrooms was an articulated concern at the February 4th Board meeting.  The closest staff restroom is in adjacent Building H – the former school administration building; that building is scheduled to be under construction beginning Summer 2016, and the modernized facility will be six classrooms and no restrooms.  Concurrently, new restroom buildings L6 and H2 are in design and will be constructed, with beneficial occupancy scheduled for early November 2016.  The graphic below indicates the designed locations of those new restrooms, which will be comprised of student and staff toilet facilities.  Those new facilities will be reasonably close to the Building K complex, and are intended to serve the occupants in Buildings K, L, G and H at the west end of campus.  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nStaff investigated the possibility of adding a single staff restroom in Building K3.  The addition of a single stall restroom would impede upon program space that was renovated in 2004 (floor plan graphic below).  If encroachment upon program space is acceptable in order to accommodate a restroom, the rough order of magnitude cost is $500,000.  If program space encroachment is unacceptable, a single staff restroom addition outside of the building would cost $600,000.  Site administration does not believe the benefit of a staff restroom in Building K3 justifies the cost, particularly in light of the new Restroom Buildings L6 and H2 that will be available soon.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \nIn 2014-15, ACE and DCP charter schools occupied Building H; they are currently no longer occupying Building H.  As of February 2016, Building H is housing McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. – the construction contractor that is modernizing Building B1.  McCarthy was directed to remove their construction trailer in the Theater Plaza upon completion of the Theater modernization project, to relinquish that area of the campus back to school operations.  In lieu of encroaching upon school operations further, the District is housing McCarthy’s project administration staff in Building H.  As of February 29, the staff restroom in Building H is also available for Independence High School staff.  This newly implemented interim mitigation measure is providing access to a staff restroom close to Building K3, until Restroom Buildings L6 and H2 open in November; however, this interim measure will not be available in the Fall 2016 semester, because Building H modernization construction will be underway.\n\t\t\t \nIH Theater Use Policy\nThe theater is available to be rented by both internal and external users.  Reservation can be made using the District’s on line reservation system (http://facilitron.com/esuhsd95133).  The request must be approved by site administration. If theater equipment is needed for the event, it triggers the additional cost of the Light/Sound Technician ($30.00 per hour, minimum of 3 hours).  No students are allowed to operate this equipment without adult supervision.  There may be additional charges depending on additional equipment needed.\n\t\t\t \nFiscal Impact:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nFunding Source:\nNot applicable\n\t\t\t \nRecommendation:\nNot applicable\n\t \n",
