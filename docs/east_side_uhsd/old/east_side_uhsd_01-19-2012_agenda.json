This was the second failure reported in the same bank of windows, the other coming in 2008.\n\t\t\t \nAs a result of this second failure, the District judged that this may not be an isolated incident and promptly implemented precautionary safety measures while evaluating the condition of the windows on the rest of the campus.

The District judged that this was not an isolated incident and in addition to implemented precautionary safety measures, retained the services of Architectural Testing, Inc. to determine the extent of the issue, provide an analysis of the cause, and provide recommendations on the best method(s) to address the repair and/or replacement of all affected windows. \n\t\t\t \nRecommendations cite that any repair or replacement will require new dual pane window units of the type specified and certified for this use. Administration has directed staff to put in motion plans to proceed with this work. In view of the fact that affected windows are disbursed across the Evergreen Valley High School campus, staff has recommended that the project be completed during the summer of 2012 – when there is a minimum of competing activity on site – and that the design-build delivery method be used to bring economies of time and money to the project. \n\t\t\t \nThe primary objectives for the project are 1) installation of windows or window systems that meet or exceed the originally designed specifications for the affected windows, 2) completion of the project prior to the start of classes in the Fall of 2012, and 3) fixed price, established by the District in its Request for Proposals. \n\t\t\t \nThe recommendation of Architectural Testing points to at least 2 means though which the end goal of replacement could be achieved. At least one of those means would require jurisdictional reviews that could potentially interrupt a summer schedule. Furthermore, lead time for delivery of suitable glass is projected to be 60+/- days, meaning that project award should be made at the March meeting of the Board of Trustees. Finally, the traditional “design-bid-build” methodology would burden the project schedule with two procurement phases – one for design and one for construction – that together would make the summer schedule infeasible.\n\t\t\t \nIt is recommended by staff that the project objectives, scope, schedule, and project budget be provided by the District in a Request for Proposals from prospective design-build teams (made up of contractors & architects or engineers) and that these teams provide proposals outlining their approach and schedule that will meet the District’s objectives for this project.\n\t\t\t \nFollowing is a summary of the anticipated project:\n\t\t\t \nGeneral Scope is: removal, repair, and reinstallation (or) replacement of 241 dual pane windows from all impacted areas on the Evergreen Valley High School campus. New windows will be inspected and certified to meet or exceed originally designed specifications or current applicable code, whichever is deemed more rigorous.\n\t\t\t \nPreliminary Schedule is:\nProcurement process for design-build teams – January 20- March 1, 2012\nBoard Recommendation of award – March Board Meeting (March 15, 2012)\nSelected team orders replacement window units – April 2, 2012\nCommencement of removal and repair or replacement (tbd) – May 29, 2012\nProject completed, inspected, certified ready for occupancy – August 3, 2012\nProject closed-out and filings completed by September 28, 2012\nProject Budget is:\nProject hard cost budget                 $203,000\nProject soft cost & contingency         $53,000\nTotal Project Budget*                       $256,000\n*inclusive of hard & soft costs, plus contingency \n\t\t\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$256,000.00\n\t\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nSchool Facilities Fund\n\t\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and direct staff to proceed with the replacement of defective windows at the Evergreen Valley High School as soon as possible, using the design-build approach as outlined, with an overall project budget not to exceed $256,000, and funding directed from Fund 35.\n\t \n",
