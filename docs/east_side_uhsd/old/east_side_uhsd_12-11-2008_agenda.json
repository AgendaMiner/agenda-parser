The Academic Master Plan initiative was designed to guide District policy and practice through the year 2015 by integrating programs, services, and facilities for 21st century student success.The three major areas of focus for the AMP included:Identification of specific programs and projects that would meet the needs of the 21st century studentIdentification of practices and programs to narrow the achievement gap and meet the requirement of Program ImprovementRecommendations on the utilization of Measure E fundsThe plan included the identification of an intersection between academic programs and renovated and newly constructed facilities, technology and equipment that provides the district with an innovative approach to equitably prioritizing resources.Approximately 450 projects were identified based on the following documents:Academic Master Plan School Site Council Project Priority ListStandardization Recommendations for Measure E fundingTechnology Master PlanDeferred Maintenance PlanFacilities Master Plan by Perkins & Will The projects identified were from the twelve main campuses and sixteen alternative campuses, charters, and programs. The cost of each project and program was individually estimated. It was determined that the total cost for all direct and indirect project costs is approximately one billion dollars. The following process was used to select the projects to be funded from the $349,000,000 allocated in Measure E:Specific criteria were developed by a team of stakeholders, including the Superintendent, Cabinet members, the Director of Technology, the Director of Construction and Facilities, the Assistant Director of Maintenance and representatives of SGI.  Each project was ranked using criteria grouped into four categories:21st Century Achievement GoalsHigh Priority EfficiencyEquityTwo major district-wide criteria were developed to provide a weighted campus ranking:Academic Performance – greatest share to go to the lowest performers based on a ration of test scores.Share of funds from previous bonds – greatest share to go to campuses that previously received the least, in proportion to amounts received.The final allocation of funds and selection of projects is based on a combination of project ranking criteria, previous bond allocations and the District goal of closing the achievement gap. The Academic Master Plan proved to be a comprehensive, equitable and transparent project which will enable EAST SIDE UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT to continue to produce students who will be productive citizens of the 21st Century.RECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Governing Board adopt the Academic Master Plan which contains recommendations for the allocation of Measure E funds.",

The Lease between the City and ESUHSD is for a term of 50 years plus one option to renew the lease for an additional 49 years; there is potentially approximately 67 years of term remaining on the existing lease.  Rent under the existing lease is $1.00 per year.  Pursuant to the existing lease, the City and library patrons also have the right to use a parking area for the library at the Independence site.  Also, the existing lease requires the District to provide for nearly all maintenance to the library building at the District’s sole cost and expense.The City now desires to construct at City’s own cost a new 18,000 square foot branch library building on approximately 1.6 acres of land on District property in a new location just south of the existing library building and adjacent to the Overfelt Gardens Park.

Supported by the State of California, the State reimbursed classes include: classes for 9th  grade students at risk of failing the High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), classes for 10th through 12th grade students who have failed subjects needed to pass the CAHSEE and for certain students in Special Education.  The State reimbursed classes are listed below:\tEnglish 1 (make-up)\t\tEnglish 2 (make-up)\t\t\t\tAlgebra I (make-up)\t\tGeometry (make-up)\tIncoming Freshmen Summer Program\tReading\t\t\t\t\tEnglish Language Development (ELD)\tHigh School Exit Exam PreparationThe estimated reimbursement from the State will continue to be on an hourly basis at the rate of $4.08 per student hour of attendance minus any applied deficit factor.Additionally, the Governor’s budget allows for enrichment and make-up classes in academic core areas other than those listed above at all grade levels.  The number of classes that can be offered is capped based on the District’s 2007 CBED’s enrollment.  Based on the state formula, the District can offer these classes to approximately 1,250 students.  This funding will be used to offer courses in the identified core academic areas as well as some elective areas consistent with the District’s Graduation Requirements.  These sections will also be funded at $3.60 per student hour of attendance minus any applied deficit factor.  Any classes beyond the cap allowed by the state are an encroachment offset by other funding from summer school. The courses offered will be from the following academic core areas:\tEnglish/Language Arts\t\t\tMathematics\tScience\t\t\t\t\tSocial Science\t\t\tForeign Language\t\t\t\tFine Arts\tPhysical EducationA description of some of the summer school programs are described below:1.\tClasses for students not demonstrating sufficient progress towards passing the CAHSEEPrograms in this category include: the Summer Language Arts and Math Institute; CAHSEE Intervention Courses; Repeat Algebra I; Repeat Geometry; English Language Development Courses; Valdes Summer Math Institute and others as appropriate. 2.\tMake-up Classes Make-up classes will be offered to non-graduating 2009 seniors needing to make-up required courses for graduation.Next priority will be given to 11th and 12th grade students and those students not demonstrating sufficient progress towards passing the CAHSEE.  Students in the 9th and 10th grades who need make-up classes will be accommodated if space permits. 3.\tEnrichmentEach school will receive student slots equaling 3% of their CBED’s enrollment, as of October 2007.  We project 700 students will be able to take advantage of enrichment courses.  These classes can be used for magnet, academy and other special programs for students who need to take extra elective classes during the school year required by those programs.  Any student wishing to advance in a curricular area or to take an elective can also enroll in a summer enrichment course.  Enrichment courses are limited to the following academic areas:  English/Language Arts, Science, Foreign Language, Mathematics, Social Science, Fine Arts or Physical Education.  Principals will make the decision about which enrichment courses are offered for which students.  The site MUST get the district’s approval for each section offered.4.\tLanguage Arts and Math Summer Institute (SMLI)The goals of the SMLI are to prepare students who are not demonstrating sufficient progress towards passing the CAHSEE for success in Algebra 1 and English 1, articulate with feeder school teachers about student achievement and curriculum focused on CAHSEE standards, and to provide professional development on best practices relating to teaching strategies and curriculum designed to prepare students for rigor of high school.5.\tSpecial EducationSpecial Education classes will be offered on all Summer School sites for Special Day Class (SDC) students who qualify for Extended School Year (ESY) services per their IEP.  RSP students may attend the regular summer school classes if needed for graduation credit.  Funding for the SDC students is provided through a daily allocation from the State Department.6.\tELL Summer SchoolThe goal is to increase the English skills of our ELL students in listening, speaking, reading and writing to a level high enough to pass the CELDT assessment at the proficient and advanced levels.  The extra support that summer school can provide will also help these students become more successful in the core curriculum classes preventing them from falling behind in meeting the graduation requirements.  This summer school program is part of the CAHSEE preparation program that is a reimbursement program from the State Department.7. \tMigrant EducationMigrant Education will be offering a summer bridge program for incoming 9th graders that been identified as migrant education students as part of the Summer Math Language Institute.  Only continuing district migrant education students will have the opportunity to recover credits through the Portable Assisted Study Sequence (PASS) Program in the areas of Mathematics, English, Social Science, and Science.  They can also earn elective credits by taking courses such as Study Skills, Career Exploration, Economic Decision Making, etc.  Incoming 12th grade migrant education students will attend a one-week college experience program that will be held on a local college campus.8.\tValdes Summer Math InstituteThe Valdes Summer Math Institute will be made available to students from our feeder schools currently in 6th, and 7th grades not demonstrating sufficient progress towards passing the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE).  The operation of this project has been a cooperative effort between the ESUHSD and our feeder school districts.  The goals of the program are to increase the number of students in Calculus for under-represented groups by preparing them for success in Algebra 1 upon entering high school, reduce the risk of students dropping out of school, and pass the CAHSEE as sophomores.  It is anticipated that the project will be housed at various local colleges and universities.  The enrollment will consist of approximately 500- 800 students. ESUHSD and its feeder elementary districts will have agreements allowing feeder district summer school ADA to fund classes for Algebra 1 and below.  The Institute will use enrichment ADA to fund higher-level classes if available.  9.\tCalifornia High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) InterventionSummer school sites will offer California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) Intervention classes for students who have taken and failed the CAHSEE to prepare students for future CAHSEE testing. CAHSEE testing will take place at all summer school sites on the July 28 and 29, 2009.10.\tAdult EducationThe East Side Adult Education Program is requesting an extension of its previously approved 2008-2009 school year to include a summer school session—June 12, 2009 through July 24, 2009. The addition of the summer school session will enable the East Side Adult Education Program to maximize its funding potential for school year 2008-09 by increasing its total number of student hours to the amount allowed by the state. It is anticipated that Adult Education will offer classes specifically designed for non-graduating 2009 seniors.Summer Graduation:Summer Graduation will take place on August 5, 2009 at Independence High School.Summer School Sites:The following school sites are being recommended as locations for summer school during the summer of 2009:1.\tEvergreen High School2.\tIndependence High School\t\t3.\tJames Lick High School 4.\tYerba Buena High School\t\t5.\tOak Grove High School\t6.\tSilver Creek High SchoolAndrew Hill, Santa Teresa, Mt.

Perkins 132 Grant 2008-09 Grant Application for East Side Adult Education ProgramOverview:The East Side Adult Education Program is part of a five program Career Technical Education consortium to receive Carl Perkins funding.  Under its guidelines adult education agencies who can not generate $50,000 in grant funding may apply for funding under a consortium model.  The four partners in the consortium are Metropolitan Adult Education, Mountain View-Los Altos Adult Education, Santa Clara Adult Education, and Sunnyvale-Cupertino Adult Education.  With the assistance of our consortium members, the East Side Adult Education has served as the lead partner in this consortium and is charged with submitting the application, monitoring the progress toward goal achievement, and evaluating the Carl Perkins plan annually.Accomplishments:Utilizing information for Central Santa Clara County from the Employment Development Department, input from the five Adult Education Program Advisory Committees, and staff and student surveys, the CTE Consortium Advisory Committee identified two industry sectors and related career pathways addressed in this five year plan.  Perkins funds will be used to assist programs in Health and Science which will focus on Clinical Nursing, Medical Assistant, and Home Health Aide Assistant career pathways.  The second industry sector is Information Technology, which will focus on Administrative Assistant, Database Administrator, Support & Services Technician, Desktop Publishing, and Accounting career pathways.  The adult education programs in the consortium offer a thriving program for the completion of a secondary education and English language development and providing career learning opportunities in health, medicine, and information technology that have numerous entry and advancements options will complement our programs.

At the request of the student’s parent or guardian, a school principal must submit to the local school governing board a request for a waiver of the requirement to pass the part(s) of the CAHSEE on which a modification was used and the equivalent of a passing score was earned.  For the local board to waive the CAHSEE requirement, the principal must certify to the local board that the pupil has all of the following:1)\tAn individualized education program adopted pursuant to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a plan adopted pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires the accommodations or modifications to be provided to the pupil when taking the high school exit examination.2)\tSufficient high school level coursework either satisfactorily completed or in progress in a high school level curriculum sufficient to have attained the skills and knowledge otherwise needed to pass the high school exit examination.3)\tAn individual score report for the pupil showing that the pupil has received the equivalent of a passing score on the high school exit examination while using a modification that fundamentally alters what the high school exit examination measures as determined by the State Board of Education.The waivers were requested by the school site administration on behalf of the students’ parents.The recommended waivers meet the aforementioned criteria delineated in Education Code Section 60851: Student A\tStudent B\tStudent C\tStudent D\tStudent E\tStudent FStudent G\tStudent H\tStudent I\tStudent J\tStudent K\tStudent LFISCAL IMPACT:NoneFUNDING SOURCE:NoneRECOMMENDATION:It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended waivers.
