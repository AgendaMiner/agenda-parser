Overfelt campus and also to reduce the total fees to be paid by LPS to the District for such facilities from $120,000 annually to $104,659.20 annually.  The attached First Amendment to the MOU addresses and memorializes the reduction in facilities and fees payable.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nPer First Amendment, As described above\n\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nNot Applicable\n\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees review and approve the proposed First Amendment to MOU regarding facilities between ESUHSD and Leadership Public Schools, Inc. as presented.\n",

This past summer, the program was expanded to include some credit recovery offerings.  This summer the District will, once again, offer summer programs at each campus.\n\t\t  \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTo be determined\n\t\t \nFUNDING SOURCE:\nTo be determined\n\t\t \nRECOMMENDATION:\nAs stipulated by the Board of Trustees\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n",

Funk, Superintendent\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nPREPARED BY:\nMarcus Battle, Associate Superintendent of Business Services, Linda da Silva, Director of Construction, Maintenance and Facilities, André Bell, Assistant Director of Capital Accounting and Purchasing, and Janice Unger, Capital Projects Purchasing Manager\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \nSUBJECT:\nPresentation, Discussion and/or Action to Award a Contract for Design-Build Services for the Districtwide Swimming Pool Modernization Project\n\t \n\t \nOn March 21, 2013, the Board of Trustees, pursuant to Education Code §17250.20, adopted Resolution 2012/2013-26 to use the design-build delivery method for the Swimming Pool Modernizations Project at James Lick, Piedmont Hills, Mt. Pleasant, Santa Teresa, Silver Creek, W.C. Overfelt and Yerba Buena High Schools (Item 15.03). \n\t \nRequest for Proposals\nThe District developed a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The RFP specified that the following selection criteria were to be considered in selecting the DBE whose proposal demonstrated the “best value” to the District, as defined in Education Code §17250.15.  The “best value” basis of evaluation allows the District to select a DBE based on more than price alone, one of the advantages of design-build in comparison to traditional delivery methods.  The first five criteria are required by Education Code §17250.15, the code section under which this design-build project is to be awarded.  The additional criteria, which are critical to the success of the project, were added at the District’s discretion.\n\t \nPrice                                                                   25  points\nTechnical Expertise                                               5  points\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years                             5  points\nSkilled Labor Force Availability                           10  points\nAcceptable Safety Record                                    5  points\nSchedule                                                             20 points\nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation   9  points\nProject Management Plan                                  10  points\nProgram Requirements                                       11 points\n\t \nTOTAL (Maximum)                  100 points\n\t \nThe RFP was issued to two Design-Build Entities (DBEs) who were prequalified for this project:  Gonsalves & Stronck Construction, Inc. (G&S) and Strawn Construction Company, Inc. (Strawn).  On February 12, 2014, the District received proposals from both DBEs; both proposals were evaluated and found to be unresponsive.  The District issued a new RFP; on January 31, 2015, we received new and responsive proposals from both prequalified DBEs.  \n\t \n\t \nProposal Evaluation Summary\nDistrict staff and construction management staff from Swinerton Management & Consulting found that while both proposals are responsive to the RFP, Strawn’s proposal provides the best value to the District.  The following summarizes the District’s assessment of the nine selection criteria, which were described in the RFP. \n\t \nPrice:  Each Design-Build Entity could earn a maximum of twenty (25) points in this category. A maximum of twenty (20) points could be earned for achieving the scope of work within the District’s stipulated budget of $11.3 million.  Another maximum of five (5) points could be earned from the value offered in the unsolicited alternates included in the proposal.\n\t \nStrawn’s proposal includes 5 new superpools and minor modernizations of 2 existing pools in the stipulated budget, along with an unsolicited alternate to upgrade the 2 minor modernizations to new superpools.  G&S’s proposal includes 3 new superpools and 4 minor modernizations, along with an unsolicited alternate to upgrade the 3 minor modernizations to new superpools.  Each proposal offers various other unsolicited alternates which enhance functionality, improve energy efficiency, lower life cycle costs, and address poor existing conditions and code deficiencies.  Strawn’s proposal in this Price category is superior to G&S’s, as reflected in the score of 22 points for Strawn and 17 points for G&S.\n\t \nTechnical Expertise: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of five (5) points in this category. \n\t \nG&S proposes an experienced team of project managers, field superintendents, architects, subcontractors and specialty consultants to design and construct this project, earning them 5 points in this category.  Strawn also proposes an experienced team, but their field superintendents have slightly less experience than those of G&S; for this reason, they earned 4 points in this category.  \n\t \nLife Cycle Costs: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of five (5) points in this category, by proposing facilities whose sustainable design results in a low life cycle cost as calculated over a twenty-five (25) year period.  The life cycle cost calculation includes the first cost of the project, operating costs, and replacement costs of any systems/components whose service lives do not exceed twenty-five (25) years. \n\t \nG&S’s proposal satisfies the program requirement of calculating life cycle costs over a twenty-five year period for the new superpools and the modernized existing pools. The proposal outlines the expected cost to be incurred by the District, not only for design and construction of the pools, but also owning, maintaining and operating them.  G&S earned 5 points in this category.  Strawn’s proposal includes life cycle costs for the new superpools only; for this reason, Strawn earned 3 points.\n\t \nSkilled Labor Force: Each DBE could earn a maximum of ten (10) points by satisfying the requirements for “skilled labor force availability” as defined in California Education Code Section 17250.10 – 17250.50.  Each was asked to evidence in its Proposal a commitment to furthering these goals:  1) maximizing opportunities for local, small and emerging businesses to compete fairly for work associated with this Project; 2) maximizing opportunities for local workers to be employed on the Project; and 3) incorporating requirements of the District’s Project Labor Agreement.\n\t \nStrawn’s proposal meets the requirement to ensure a skilled labor force on this project. Their proposal describes how they will utilize a local union workforce and create 7 high school student summer internships, earning them 10 points.  G&S’s proposal similarly commits to using a union workforce and creating summer internships, but with less specificity, earning them 9 points.\n\t \nAcceptable Safety Record: Each DBE could earn a maximum score of five (5) points in this category.  Three (3) points could be earned by demonstrating an acceptable safety record.  An additional two (2) points could be earned by submitting a superior Project Safety Plan (PSP), evidencing an exceptionally comprehensive Injury & Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), and having a low Experience Modification Factor rating. \n\t \nThe primary metric of an acceptable safety record is a contractor’s Experience Modification Rate (EMR), which is a measure of the frequency of accidents and injuries that a contractor has incurred on a historical basis.  G&S’s EMR of .66 is significantly better than the industry average of 1.0, they provided evidence of an IIPP as well as the outline of a PSP; they earned 4 points in this category.  Strawn’s EMR of .83 is also better than industry average, they provided evidence of an IIPP, and their PSP was complete and superior in demonstrating their commitment to a safe campus environment during the construction period for students, staff and construction workers; Strawn earned 5 points in this category.\n\t \nSchedule: Each DBE could earn a maximum of twenty (20) points by proposing creative scheduling that will reduce the overall length of time of construction, as well as minimize the impact on the sites as a whole. \n\t \nBoth DBEs proposed aggressive project schedules, and G&S’s proposal even includes several schedule options for consideration.  Strawn’s proposed schedule includes more realistic timelines for Division of the State Architect review of the plans prior to construction, along with written commitment from their swimming pool subcontractor on the aggressive construction schedule, earning Strawn 16 points in this category.  G&S earned 15 points in this category; the evaluation panel was impressed with the flexibility \noffered with the multiple schedule options, which while not required in the RFP, indicates an understanding by G&S’s team of the schedule concerns of various project stakeholders.\n\t \nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation: Each DBE could earn a maximum of nine (9) points in this category, through the quality of their design solutions as well as the level of innovation reflected in each DBE’s design solution, and its overall approach to constructing the Project. \n\t \nStrawn’s proposal provides design narratives, outline specifications, and site plans for each school’s pool.  Their proposed superpool offers the minimum code-required amount of shallow water for physical education and non deep-water safe swimmers.  Their proposal earned Strawn 7 points in this category.  G&S’s proposal provides design narratives and outline specifications, and typical site plans for the various pool options offered within the stipulated sum and as unsolicited alternates.  G&S’s proposed superpool design includes a more gracious shallow water area.  G&S’s proposal earned 6 points in this category.  \n\t \nProject Management Plan: Each DBE could earn a maximum of ten (10) points by evidencing superiority in their proposed logistics plan, quality assurance/quality control plan, structure of organizational chart, knowledge/skill/ability/experience of key personnel, Owner/Design-Build Entity interaction strategies, and other aspects of project management. \n\t \nG&S’s proposal includes information that conveys their plan adequately, which earned them 8 points in this category.  Strawn’s proposal includes the required information, plus additional information that offers a superior understanding of how they plan to interact with stakeholders and their design philosophy for each design discipline, which earned them 9 points in this category.\n\t \nProgram Requirements: Each DBE could earn a maximum of eleven (11) points by proposing design(s) that achieves the District’s aquatic program components. \n\t \nStrawn’s proposal of 5 new superpools plus 2 existing pool modernizations within the stipulated budget achieves more aquatic program satisfaction than G&S’s 3+4 proposal.  Strawn earned 8 points in this category, and G&S earned 6 points.\n\t \nBased on the proposal evaluation criteria described above, the final score for each DBE is as follows:\n\t \nSelection Criteria\nMaximum Possible\nPoints\nGonsalves & Stronck Construction\nStrawn Construction\nPrice\n25\n17\n22\nTechnical Expertise\n5\n5\n4\nLife Cycle Costs over 25 Years\n5\n5\n3\nSkilled Labor Force Availability\n10\n9\n10\nAcceptable Safety Record\n5\n4\n5\nSchedule\n20\n15\n16\nArchitectural Aesthetics and Design Innovation\n9\n6\n7\nProject Management Plan\n10\n8\n9\nProgram Requirements\n11\n6\n8\n                                                     Total \n100\n75\n84\n\t \n\t \nThe RFP specified that following the scoring of each DBE’s proposal, at which time the DBE whose proposal is deemed most responsive to the RFP was determined, and pursuant to Education Code §17250.25(a)(2)(v), the District reserved the right to hold discussions or negotiations with that DBE for the purpose of receiving clarification and/or modification to their proposal, in order to achieve a resulting Best and Final Proposal that could be recommended to the Board of Trustees for contract award.  \n\t \nBudget Augmentation\nPrior to entering into negotiations with Strawn, District administration engaged the Board at the March 5, 2015 meeting to request a budget augmentation that would allow the design and construction of new superpools at all seven school sites affected by the project.  On March 5, 2015, the Board of Trustees augmented the budget in an amount not to exceed $7.2 million (Item 15.01).  In addition, the Board stated that those schools with the desire to increase the size of their swimming pools could do so, using site-directed bond funding allocations.   \n\t \nAquatics Programming Needs Assessment at each School Site \nDistrict Facilities staff, Strawn Construction’s design team and Swinerton Management met with each of the Principals, aquatics coaching staff and athletic directors to review the existing and future aquatics activities and program needs.  Based upon these meetings, the aquatic program needs for the seven schools are as follows:  \n\t \nPhysical Education / Swim Instruction \nCompetitive Swimming \nWater Polo \nDiving \n\t \nAll of these aquatic programs could be accommodated with the budgeted superpool size of 6,255 square feet. Five schools (James Lick, Piedmont Hills, Silver Creek, W.C. Overfelt and Yerba Buena) have approved an H-shaped superpool configuration.  Two schools (Mt. Pleasant, Santa Teresa) have larger competitive aquatics programs and are requesting larger superpools. \n\t \nBest and Final Proposal Negotiations\nStrawn’s base price for design and construction of 5 superpools plus minor modernization of 2 existing pools is $11.3 million.  District staff from Capital Purchasing, Facilities and Swinerton Management met with Strawn Construction to solicit and negotiate their Best and Final Proposal, based on the verified needs of each school site and inclusion of the unsolicited alternates offered in Strawn’s proposal that decrease life cycle cost, improve functionality, and address poor existing conditions and code deficiencies outside of the base scope.  Strawn can design and construct 7 H-shaped superpools, including the selected unsolicited alternates, for $17,365,985; sufficient funds are available in the current budget.  To address the request for upsizing at Mt. Pleasant and Santa Teresa, the additional cost to enlarge those pools is as follows:\n\t \nSCHOOL\nINCREASE SIZE \nADDITIONAL COST\nMt. Pleasant \n2 additional competitive lanes \n$350,000 \nSanta Teresa \n25 yard x 35 meter pool \n$1,185,000\n\t \nSite Councils at these schools have approved reallocation of their site-directed bond funding from other projects, in order to cover the additional cost of larger pools.  Funding to cover these additional costs will be from the de-funding of the following projects:  \nSanta Teresa\nGymnasium Building 700 Foyer Modernization:  $1,100,000 \nTennis Courts Expansion: $850,000\nMt. Pleasant\nPractice Field Renovation:  $360,000\n\t \nStrawn Construction’s Best and Final Proposal to design and construct new superpools at 7 school sites, including upsizing of the superpools at Mt. Pleasant and Santa Teresa, and including the unsolicited alternates that decrease life cycle cost, improve functionality, and address poor existing conditions and code deficiencies outside of the base scope is $18,900,985.\n\t \n                                                                                               \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n\t \nAmount\nFunding Source\nNotes\n$     1,877,121\nMeasure G (Site Improvements / Deferred Maintenance)\nBoard approved September 15, 2011, Board Item 13.01\n$     8,288,864\nMeasure I\nBoard approved December 11, 2012, Board Item 16.03\n$     5,131,188\nMeasure G (Residual Interest Revenue)\nBoard approved March 5, 2015, Board Item 15.01\n$     2,068,812\nMeasure E (Board Discretionary)\nBoard approved March 5, 2015, Board Item 15.01\n$     1,100,000\nMeasure E (Santa Teresa)\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$          85,000\nMeasure I  (Santa Teresa)\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$        350,000\nMeasure E (Mt.
