The two scopes of work will be funded separately; Measure C will fund the MLC fencing and curb cut project and Campus Center Use Fees will fund the Campus Center fencing project. \n\t \nRatcliff Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department. \n\t \nBid #1680-261 was legally advertised to contractors April 17, 2014, and April 24, 2014.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  A mandatory bid walk was held on May 1, 2014, and a total of four (4) contractors attended the walk.  Bids were publicly opened and read on May 21, 2014 in the Purchasing Services office.  Two (2) contractors submitted a bid and the bid results are summarized below:\n\t \nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\nTotal cost for MLC fence and curb cut incl. a $5,000 allowance for unforeseen conditions \nTotal cost of Campus Center fence incl. a $5,000 allowance for unforeseen conditions \nTOTAL BASE BID PROPOSAL AMOUNT\nR.C.

Benson exceeds the architect’s construction estimate of $105,000; however, upon review it is noted that the architect’s estimate did not include a portion of the MLC fencing that was added by Amendment #2 nor a revised fence layout at the Campus Center.  After inclusion of costs in the estimate for these omissions, the bids are reasonable in comparison to the estimate. Funding is available from Measure C Project 261 for the MLC Fencing and Curb Cut project and from the Campus Center Use Fees fund for the Campus Center Fence project.  Therefore, the Measure C bond team and College Operations recommend award of a contract for the Total Base Bid amount to R.C.

These weaknesses were discovered during construction when SJ Amoroso started to repair the building’s gutters and other adjacent glulam beams that were in the original project scope (ref;  attached photo #5). Attached are photos #9 & #10 that indicate the difficulty of access to these beams and provide an idea of the amount of roof removal that is required to implement repairs.\n\t \nRepair work includes temporary shoring, structural steel plate reinforcing, painting, and a significant amount of roof removal and replacement to implement the repairs.  This change order includes a no-cost time extension to complete the glulam repairs, which will be substantially complete before the Fall quarter begins. The base contract scope will still be completed on time in August.\n\t \nCompleting this work as a change order is necessary because of the potential for structural failure and the necessity to finish the work with minimal disturbance to Fall Quarter classes. Deferring repairs to these roof beams was considered so that the work could be put out to competitive bid but is not recommended due to the delay that would result in completing the work (approximately one year), and the additional costs that would be incurred if the work is done after the current renovation is complete.\n\t \nThis change plus all previously approved change orders equal to 13.5% of the base contract value.
