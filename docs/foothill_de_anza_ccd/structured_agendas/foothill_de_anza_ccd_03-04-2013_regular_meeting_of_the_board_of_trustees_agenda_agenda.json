The attached executive summary of the change in the law details the rationale for adoption of the new policy.\n\t \nDistrict administrative procedures (AP) 3500 and 3501 have been revised to allow for the special events exemption in addition to the previously allowed exceptions for Foundation sponsored fundraising events (Section 25608{a}(10)) and for certain events at the Flint Center which are not sponsored by the College District and held while the Flint Center is under lease to a private, non-profit corporation (section 25608{a}(5)). The approved administrative procedures are included for clarification.\n\t \nLegal counsel vetted the new policy and revised procedures, and the Chancellor’s Advisory Council reviewed and approved both the changes to the administrative procedures and the new policy on January 25, 2013.\n\t \nThe policy will be presented for approval at the March 11, 2013 Board of Trustees meeting.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nKevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor of Business Services, extension 6201\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

The questionnaires were evaluated based upon the following key evaluation factors: license information, litigation history, construction experience, safety history, bonding capacity, insurance capacity, and financial capacity.  Public Contract Code Section 20101(a) mandates that the questionnaire responses of prospective bidders and their financial statements shall not be deemed public records and shall not be open to public inspection.\n\t \nPurchasing Services staff and the Foothill College Measure E Bond Program Director evaluated the responses and determined that fourteen (14) of the nineteen (19) contractors meet the minimum requirements of the prequalification questionnaire, including a point score of 80 or higher out of a total possible 100 points. \n\t \nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nCONTRACTOR\nPREQUALIFIED\nAlpha Bay Builders, Inc.\nNo\nAlten Construction, Inc.\nYes\nS.

The number of litigation claims reported and the number of safety citations reported resulted in overall low scores in these two categories.\n\t \nBeals Martin Associates, Inc. submitted an incomplete package, it submitted only one of three required reference projects and it submitted only two of three years financials statements required.  Furthermore, Beals Martin does not meet the minimum EMR requirements.  Beals Martin’s calculated three (3) year average exceeds 1.0.  \n\t \nCal-Pacific Construction, Inc. did not submit the required project data sheets for its referenced projects. Cal-Pacific also did not submit the required signed declaration from its surety company that verifies its bonding capacity and it did not complete the requirements to verify its safety plan.  Even if Cal-Pacific would have submitted and completed the required documentation, its three-year averaged profitability ratio results in a net loss.  Therefore, Cal-Pacific is not able to meet the minimum requirement for the profitability ratio as stated in the PQ documents.\n\t \nGonsalves & Stronck Construction Co., Inc.’s three-year averaged profitability ratio results in a net loss.  Therefore, it is not able to meet the minimum requirement for the profitability ratio as stated in the PQ documents.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.

The questionnaires were evaluated based upon the following key evaluation factors: license information, litigation history, construction experience, safety history, bonding capacity, insurance capacity, and financial capacity.  Public Contract Code Section 20101(a) mandates that the questionnaire responses of prospective bidders and their financial statements shall not be deemed public records and shall not be open to public inspection.\n\t \nPurchasing Services staff and the Foothill College Measure C Bond Program Director evaluated the responses and determined that eight (8) of the eleven (11) contractors meet the minimum requirements of the prequalification questionnaire, including a point score of 80 or higher out of a total possible 100 points. \n\t \nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nCONTRACTOR\nPREQUALIFIED\nAlten Construction, Inc.\nYes\nArntz Builders, Inc. \nNo\nBeals Martin Associates, Inc. \nNo\nCalstate Construction, Inc. \nYes\nDilbeck & Sons, Inc.\nYes\nD.L.

Griffin Inc. \nYes\nJeff Luchetti Construction, Inc.\nYes\nSwenson & Associates\nYes\nTaber Construction, Inc. \nYes\nTransworld Construction, Inc. \nNo\n\t \nThe Board can choose to either:\n          1. Accept the list of eight (8) General Contractors who met all of the prequalification requirements   \n              as the only prime contractors who are “prequalified” to bid on Foothill College Measure C\n              Projects #115 - Fine Arts Scene Shop or #173 - Print Shop and Plant Services, OR \n          2.  Cancel the prequalification procedure for this project.\n\t \nIn order to be prequalified, Contractors were required to meet certain minimum requirements and achieve an overall score of 80% or more.  Contractors were required to (1) show that they have successfully completed renovation projects of similar size and scope of work; (2) provide information regarding litigation claims history; (3) provide verified documentation regarding its safety and OSHA history in the state of California; (4) provide information that confirms its ability to obtain insurance in the limits necessary for the project; (5) provide confirmation of its capacity to bond a project of the required size; and (6) provide three years of financial statements to verify debt ratios, liquidity ratios and positive profitability ratios.  \n\t \nArntz Builders, Inc. earned a score of less than the required minimum 80 points to prequalify. The number of litigation claims reported and the number of safety citations reported resulted in overall low scores for these two categories.\n\t \nBeals Martin Associates, Inc. submitted an incomplete package; it submitted only one of three required reference projects and it submitted only two of three years financials statements required.  Furthermore, Beals Martin does not meet the minimum Experience Modification Ratings (EMR) requirements within the PQ, which is a calculated average of 1.0 or less over the past three (3) years.  Its calculated three (3) year average exceeds 1.0.  The EMR is an insurance industry measurement of a company’s safety record that compares past actual experience to the expected or average experience. \n\t \nThe other contractor that did not meet the prequalification requirements, Transworld Construction, Inc., also does not meet the minimum EMR requirements.  Transworld’s calculated three (3) year average exceeds 1.0.  Purchasing Services notified Transworld of the prequalification results in accordance with the PQ documents and Transworld responded with a request for a “Prequalification Appeal Hearing.”  After consulting with District legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret, Purchasing Services conducted an appeal hearing for Transworld on January 25, 2013.  Annette Perez, Senior Buyer, and Gina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing Services, represented the District. Mr. Eric Lui represented Transworld. As a result of the hearing, Purchasing Services confirmed Transworld’s OSHA safety citations and its EMR average, and therefore the scoring for Transworld remained unchanged.   Hence, Purchasing Services notified Transworld that it would recommend that the Board of Trustees not prequalify Transworld for Measure C Projects #115 - Fine Arts Scene Shop or #173 - Print Shop and Plant Services.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.

The intent of the RFQ was to establish a pool of architecture and landscape architecture firms qualified to provide services for projects to be undertaken by the District over the next three years.  This group was not intended to replace firms already selected, but to augment that group with firms focused on small projects. \n\t \nThe RFQ was advertised on Bidnet and local firms thought to be qualified were contacted directly and encouraged to apply.  On September 18, 2012, the District received responses to the RFQ from thirty-four firms interested in the design of small projects. \n\t \nA selection committee deliberated regarding the completeness and quality of responses, experience related to District projects, qualifications and experience of proposed team members and fee structure. Because the amount of work available for the small projects is not extensive, twelve firms were identified as being best qualified:  ANLA Associates, Inc.; Artik Art & Architecture; Bellinger Foster Steinmetz; John Miller Architects; K2A Architects + Interiors; Keller and Daseking Architects; MdKim Design Group; Meyer + Silberberg Land Architects; Prodis Associates Architects; Sissela Malmstrom Architect; Studio Perez; and Verde Design Group.  \n\t \nNo commitment was made in the RFQ to employ every selected firm; final selections to provide services for individual projects will be based upon project needs, experience and qualification related to the project, availability relative to project schedules, references, and comparative cost proposals.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nCharles Allen, Exec.

The scope of work includes hazardous material abatement; interior floor plan changes and new interior finishes; new exterior finishes; structural repairs and new roofing for building 5800; and new HVAC equipment and controls, electrical, lighting, plumbing, fire alarm, and telecommunications systems throughout.  The project also includes landscaping of areas surrounding the buildings, improvements to two courtyards, and site work required for installation of a modular office building for temporary relocation of some building occupants. The improvements to the two courtyards were identified as deductive alternates in the Bid Proposal, and the contract award will not include  construction of that scope.\n\t \nHMC Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department.\n\t \nBid 1623-105 was legally advertised on December 14 and December 21, 2012.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com. Bids were publicly opened and read on February 7, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. by Purchasing Services.  The bid results are shown below:\n\t \nCONTRACTOR\nBASE BID PROPOSAL AMOUNT\nDEDUCTIVE ALTERNATE #1 – Courtyard O\nDEDUCTIVE ALTERNATE #2 – Courtyard N\nTOTAL AMOUNT\nS. J. Amoroso Construction Co., Inc.\n$10,847,000\n($110,000)\n($187,000)\n$10,550,000\nSwenson & Associates\n$10,990,000\n($172,000)\n($141,000)\n$10,677,000\nC. W. Driver, Inc.\n$11,600,000\n($  79,000)\n($145,000)\n$11,376,000\n\t \nThe lowest responsive and responsible bidder is S. J. Amoroso Construction Co., Inc. (Amoroso). Furthermore, Amoroso and its listed subcontractors have each signed the “Agreement To Be Bound” and the “Agreement of Contractors” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.  \n\t \nThe architect’s estimate for the project (including acceptance of deductive bid alternates) was $8,120,000.  The corresponding total bid amount of $10,550,000 exceeds the amount budgeted for the project.  \nThe scope of this project is very similar to past Foothill College building renovations but has produced a higher price, indicating that bid prices have begun to rise from their lows of the past several years.  It is also likely that the estimate did not anticipate all costs related to the way the project is phased to allow laboratory classes to continue during construction.  \n\t \nThe three bids received were quite similar, indicating that they represent the true market value of the work and that it is unlikely that rebidding the project will produce a better result.  Because of that consideration and because the project renovates critical teaching spaces, a budget transfer proposed on this Board agenda will augment the budget to allow completion of the project as planned.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.
