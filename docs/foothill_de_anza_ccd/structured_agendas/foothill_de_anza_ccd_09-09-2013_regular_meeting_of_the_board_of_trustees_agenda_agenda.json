De Anza staff and District staff are proceeding forward with several purchases of technology equipment, furniture, equipment and supplies to ensure a successful opening.  Several classroom labs within the ATC require computer tables that can also function as regular classroom desks.  The De Anza FF&E Coordinator worked to locate products that would fit that need. Product proposals from three potential manufacturers were considered: a proposal from KI, a proposal from Spectrum Industries, and a proposal from ISE, Inc.   After review of the table specifications required based upon function and the classroom layouts, KI determined that it would not be able to provide a viable solution. Spectrum and ISE each manufacture the tables that meet the campus need in a manual and electric version.  Both vendors also indicated they would modify the size of the tables to meet the spatial requirements of the classrooms while maintaining the desired seat count.  Samples of the tables were provided to the campus for testing.  \n \nThe De Anza College VP of Instruction and several Deans tested the functionality of the tables and discussed the pros and cons of the manual version versus the electric version. They concluded that the electric version of the tables was the best fit for the campus needs and the preferred choice was the Spectrum product.  Initially, Spectrum provided a quote for the electric tables however it later rescinded the quote and informed the District that a corporate decision had been made to no longer sell the electric version of the table because of its concerns regarding long-term performance of its product or any similar electric product.  Even though campus administration strongly preferred the electric version of the table, Spectrum’s concern regarding any electric version of the table prompted the campus to rethink the purchase of the electric version.  To clarify whether other vendors shared the concerns expressed by Spectrum, Purchasing Service staff contacted ISE regarding the performance of its electric table.  ISE confirmed in writing that it stood behind its product and would provide the District with a lifetime warranty on all electrical and moving parts.  Furthermore, Purchasing Staff and the De Anza FF&E Coordinator reached out to other public agencies in California who purchased the tables to verify the performance of tables in use.  As a result of this research, the De Anza administration continues to firmly believe that it is in the best interest of the District to purchase the ISE electronic version of the table.  \n \nPublic Contract Code (PCC) section 20652, often referred to as the \"piggy back\" statute, provides that community college districts may under certain conditions utilize contracts that have been awarded by other public entities when the governing board finds it to be in the best interest of the District.  To conduct a competitive bid at this time would take approximately 3 - 4 months to complete the bid and award process plus an additional 6-8 weeks to deliver the product upon receipt of a Purchase Order.  Therefore, Purchasing Staff recently worked with ISE and its local dealer, Pivot Interiors, Inc. to determine if there were any competitively bid state or national contracts that it could take advantage of pursuant to PCC 20652 while leveraging the most advantageous pricing from such contract.  ISE and Pivot prepared a price quote for the purchase of the electric tables based off of a contract that is administered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Accomplishing our due diligence on this potential purchase involved obtaining factual confirmations that those conditions for use of PCC section 20652 do exist. District legal counsel, Mr. John Shupe of Lynch and Shupe, LLP also reviewed the information for contract validity for California community colleges and provided guidance in our due diligence efforts.  Because of the quirky language of PCC Section 20652, there is always a risk when a community college district makes its piggyback purchase directly with the vendor rather than through the public agency that obtained the favorable pricing structure. Mr. Shupe is satisfied that the risks associated with the purchase contracts we are proposing are minimal and acceptable. We have investigated and confirmed the following. First, the price proposal from ISE is piggybacked off of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of General Services (Commonwealth) contract #4400009429. That contract also allows for contracted items to be reconfigured (modified to fit the special requirements). Second, we have learned that this Commonwealth contract contains a clause explicitly providing that other public entities can piggyback upon its pricing structure. Third, our investigation revealed that the Commonwealth contract with ISE was entered into after a valid, competitive bid process. Fourth, the contract states that all purchase orders and invoicing/payments will be made directly to the contractor of record (ISE). Fifth, while the contract does include a small service (installation) component, which if let separately might be within a bid requirement, in counsel's view that component is related enough and small enough that it is acceptable to include it in this piggyback purchase.\n \nThe total cost of this procurement is $287,279.14 and will be funded through Measure C FF&E.
