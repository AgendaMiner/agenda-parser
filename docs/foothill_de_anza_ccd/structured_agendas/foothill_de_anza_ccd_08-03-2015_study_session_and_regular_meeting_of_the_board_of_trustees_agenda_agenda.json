The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builder’s exchanges and advertised in the San Jose Post Record as well as posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Bids were publicly opened and read on May 14, 2015 in the Purchasing Services office. Only one (1) contractor submitted a bid, Calstate Construction, Inc., at a price of $149,500 for the Base Bid Proposal Amount.\n\t \nCalstate Construction, Inc. has confirmed that its bid amount of $149,500 is true and accurate for the work as specified and it will subcontract the well drilling to one of the premier well drillers in the Bay Area.  Calstate previously completed the DOB Swing Space project at Foothill College and also the G Building Renovation project at De Anza College. It is currently under contract for the Kiosks at De Anza College.\n\t \nMeasure C scheduled maintenance will fund the project. \n\t \nIncluded as an attachment is background information including a summary of actions taken prior to bid award and information regarding groundwater conditions in the area.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey - Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Steve Kitchen - Director of Facilities & Operations, Jennifer Mahato - Project Manager\nIs backup provided?\n  Yes\n\t \n",
