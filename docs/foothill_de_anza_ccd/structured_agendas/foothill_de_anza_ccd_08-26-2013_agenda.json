                    "item_details": "\nBackground and Analysis:\n\t \nETS has been developing a plan for the consolidation of computer servers and desktop computers through “virtualization” technology.  This technology essentially allows one physical server to function as multiple virtual servers or desktop computers.  This technology is widely used in many industries including higher education.  The benefits of virtualization technology over traditional resources are many including reduced total cost of ownership: improved computing performance; enhanced access for students, faculty, and staff; reduced energy consumption; and reduced space requirements.  The deployment of server virtualization technology is a key design factor in the renovation of the District’s data center.  Desktop and application virtualization is a critical component in the District’s strategy to improve access to technology for students and extend the life of end user computing devices.\n\t \nETS has negotiated a price proposal for the procurement of hardware and technology software, including three years of hardware maintenance and a three-year license support agreement for the software with Dell Marketing, L.P. (Dell).  Through this proposal Dell will provide all necessary server, storage, and switching hardware along with server and desktop virtualization software from VMWare to establish an initial virtualization platform.  This platform will provide for the consolidation of nearly all existing physical servers located in the De Anza campus L7 data center.  The platform will also support 1000 virtual desktop computers that will begin to be deployed with the opening of the ATC building at De Anza in Winter Quarter 2014. As Dell is the exclusive provider of this hardware and a preferred provider for the software, future maintenance and support agreements will need to be executed with Dell for support beyond year three.\n\t \nPublic Contract Code (PCC) section 20652, often referred to as the \"piggy back\" statute, provides that community college districts may under certain conditions utilize contracts that have been awarded by other public entities when the governing board finds it to be in the best interest of the District. Accomplishing our due diligence on this matter involved obtaining factual confirmations that those conditions for use of PCC section 20652 do exist. We have investigated and confirmed the following. First, the price proposal with Dell for the hardware is piggybacked off of the Western States Contracting Alliance (WSCA) Master Price Agreement B27160 that is currently used by the District for the purchase of desktops, laptops, and servers and the price proposal for the VMWare software is based upon a purchase agreement with Dell negotiated by a Texas public entity known as Region 14 Education Services Center (\"Region 14\"). Second, we have learned that this Region 14 purchase agreement contains a clause explicitly providing that other public entities can piggyback upon its pricing structure. Third, our investigation revealed that the Region 14 purchase agreement with Dell was entered into after a valid, competitive bid process. Fourth, we have obtained confirmation that the standard used involves a direct District purchase from the vendor (Dell) rather than a purchase through and contract with Region 14. Piggybacking off this Region 14 contract with Dell for the software is administered by a National Cooperative Purchasing Alliance (NCPA) Contract #01-01.  ETS staff has worked diligently with Dell to obtain the most advantageous pricing for the District in its negotiations for all components of this proposal.  Additionally, ETS believes that pricing structures leveraged through these contracts are equal to or better than what the District could obtain for the software components if it were to conduct its own bid for the same virtualization technology.  Furthermore, District legal counsel, Mr. John Shupe of Lynch and Shupe, LLP, reviewed the proposal and the NCPA contract, and provided guidance in our due diligence efforts. Because of the quirky language of PCC Section 20652, there is always a risk when a community college district makes its piggyback purchase directly with the vendor rather than through the public agency which obtained the favorable pricing structure. Mr. Shupe is satisfied that the risks associated with the purchase contracts we are proposing are minimal and acceptable.\n\t \nThe total cost of this procurement is approximately $1.2 million and will be funded through Measure C for the initial equipment and software investment.  The on-going costs will be paid for through the General Fund.  The complete technical specifications and precise parts list are currently being finalized by ETS and will have a negligible impact on the final total cost.  \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJoseph Moreau, Vice Chancellor of Technology, x6120\nAdditional contact names:\n Gina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing, x6195\nIs backup provided?\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n",
