Because the estimated cost of the furniture will exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $84,100, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking”. The competitively bid Foundation for California Community Colleges (FCCC) contract with Kruger International is available and it includes the items required by the colleges. \n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the prices offered on the FCCC contract for the same goods and services. The FCCC contract establish discounts for furniture inclusive of specification development services, space planning services, installation drawings, shipping and delivery costs, a 15-year parts and labor warranty, and installation services. \n\t \nIn addition, Krueger International makes a donation of one percent for all purchases to the California Community Colleges Scholarship Endowment.  All donations that result from the District’s purchases will be allocated to the District’s account and the resulting scholarships will go to the Foothill-De Anza students.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\nBernata Slater, Donna Jones Dulin, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",
