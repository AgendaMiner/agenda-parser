Purchasing Services staff also contacted twenty-four (24) companies regarding the RFQ/RFP opportunity. \n\t \nRepresentatives from eight (8) contractor companies attended at least one of the two mandatory pre-submittal conferences held on March 19 and April 17, 2013. Two (2) contractors, C. Overaa & Company (Overaa) and Taber Construction Company (Taber), submitted Statements of Qualifications (SOQ’s) in response to RFQ/RFP #1426-239 by the May 8, 2013 deadline. \n\t \nA Selection Committee was established to evaluate the responses to the RFQ/RFP. The eight (8) member Selection Committee consisted of: Donna Jones-Dulin – Associate Vice President of College Operations; Lester Lyons – Associate Director of Facilities; Tom Armstrong – Director of Bond Program Management – De Anza College; Roseanne Sciacchitano – District Project Manager; Ella Bisconti – Project Manager for Gilbane-MAAS; Merideth Marschack – Noll & Tam Architects; Jonathan Stafford – Simpson Gumpertz & Heger; and Annette Perez – Purchasing Services Senior Buyer.  The committee evaluated each of the SOQ’s for responsiveness (including financial capacity, safety record, and similar project experiences) and invited Overaa and Taber to continue with the interview and RFP steps.\n\t \nThe Selection Committee conducted interviews with Overaa and Taber on June 12, 2013 and responses to the RFP were received on June 26, 2013.  The RFP responses included competitive fee proposals for preconstruction services, construction services, contractor’s contingency, and contractor’s overhead and profit.  Based on the proposals provided in relation to the scores of the RFQ and the interviews, Overaa had the score with the lowest cost per qualification point and earned the top ranking. \n\t \nThe Selection Committee recommends award of a Preconstruction Services Agreement (see attached) to Overaa so that it can develop a Preliminary Construction Schedule, proceed with reviewing the design documentation for constructability, prequalify subcontractors for bidding, obtain competitive bids from subcontractors, and develop a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the project. Overaa’s fee for Preconstruction Services is $40,112. The Preconstruction Services Agreement, paragraph VII(C), provides that the contractor will be reimbursed at actual cost for reimbursable services defined as printing, advertising, and site condition confirmation. Overaa proposed and District staff agreed that Overaa’s estimated reimbursable services will not exceed  $25,000.  The total not to exceed cost for the Preconstruction Services Agreement is $65,112.\n\t \nProvided that District and Overaa agree to a GMP, project milestone dates, and completion dates indicated in the Preliminary Construction Schedule, District staff plans to return to the Board as early as December 2, 2013 and recommend award of the Site Lease and Facilities Lease agreements to Overaa to construct the Project based upon DSA-approved construction documents within the agreed-upon duration for an amount not to exceed the GMP.  Under the two agreements, the District will lease District-owned land to Overaa and in return Overaa will agree to construct the project pursuant to the District’s Construction Provisions and Overaa’s responses to RFQ/RFP #1426-239.  The District will receive incremental title to the constructed property in accordance with payments made.  The District will pay for and take title to all improvements no later than completion of construction of the project at which time the leases will be terminated.\n\t \nThese services are within the project budget and are funded by Measure C.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nTom Armstrong, Director of Bond Program Management – De Anza College; Charles Allen, Executive Director of Facilities, Operations, and Construction Management; Annette Perez, Senior Buyer, Purchasing Services. \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

The cost of the furniture is estimated not to exceed $825,000 and it will be purchased with Measure C funds.  Because the estimated cost of the furniture will exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $83,400, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities pursuant to Public Contract Code (PCC) 20652. \n \nOn August 2, 2010, the Board of Trustees authorized a pricing agreement and the use of two competitively bid Foundation for California Community Colleges (FCCC) contracts pursuant to PCC 20652 with Kruger International (KI). Purchasing Services negotiated with KI to obtain the highest tier discount on all of its purchases against the FCCC contracts, regardless of the dollar amount through the term of the agreement that ended July 31, 2012. This is known as a “Tier” 8 discount. The discount varies depending on the product line within a range of 52% to 61% off list price.  Although the agreement expired on July 31, 2012, the proposals obtained for the ATC building are also quoted at the “Tier” 8 pricing discount. It is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the “Tier” 8 prices offered on the FCCC contracts for the same goods and services. The FCCC contracts establish discounts for furniture inclusive of specification development services, space planning services, installation drawings, shipping and delivery costs, a 15-year non-prorated parts and labor warranty, and installation services. FCCC contract # CAC-B-008 for academic furniture is valid through October 26, 2013 and FCCC contract # CAC-B-009 for administrative furniture is valid through August 23, 2013.\n \nAs required by the FCCC contracts, KI makes a donation of 1% for all purchases to the California Community Colleges Scholarship Endowment.  All donations that result from the District’s purchases will be allocated to the District’s account and the resulting scholarships will go to the Foothill-De Anza students.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Gina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Donna Jones-Dulin, Janet Couch-Vong, Dawn Allshouse\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",
