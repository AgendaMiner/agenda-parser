Western States Contracting Alliance (WSCA) is a contracting consortium for state government departments, institutions, agencies and political subdivisions in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\t \nIn fall 2012, WSCA entered into an agreement with six providers for wireless communication and equipment services that was publicly bid and awarded by the State of Nevada. WSCA Agreement No.1907 is valid through October 31, 2016. The WSCA contract pricing is posted at http://www.aboutwsca.org/contract.cfm/contract/w4-2001.\n\t \nOn November 5, 2012, the board of trustees authorized a contract with Sprint Solutions, Inc. for wireless (cellular) services, radio services, equipment, and repairs based upon the terms and conditions of WSCA Agreement No. 1907 through June 30, 2013.  The board was also informed that District staff would evaluate the services and rates of the local providers that participated in the contract to determine whether there would be a benefit in switching services to a different provider.\n\t \nPricing proposals for wireless communication and equipment services were solicited from all six of the providers who participated in the WSCA agreement. Facilities and Purchasing staff evaluated the proposals. Three of the providers did not offer the Push-To-Talk (PTT) radio feature, which is an essential function required to meet the District’s communication needs for the police, custodial, and facilities operations. The three providers who can provide PTT, cellular, and data communications are AT&T Mobility, Sprint Solutions, Inc. and Verizon Wireless.   \n\t \nA comprehensive cost comparison was analyzed between each of the three providers taking into consideration the initial cost of replacement equipment and the District’s current monthly-averaged PTT usage, cellular telephone usage, and data usage. All three providers can provide dependable coverage for PTT, cellular, and data communication in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Furthermore, ETS staff determined that smart phone compatibility with Outlook Exchange is satisfactory for all providers based upon the proposed equipment.   The proposal that was determined to provide the best value is from Verizon Wireless based upon the initial purchase price of equipment amortized over a two-year life cycle and the estimated annual cost for services. Although the initial cost for equipment is much greater for Verizon Wireless, the estimated averaged monthly cost for ongoing services plus the cost of equipment based upon a two-year life cycle is less than\nAT & T Mobility and Sprint Solutions, Inc.\n\t \nFor fiscal year 2013 – 2014, the estimated cost based upon current usage from each of the three responsive providers is summarized below:\n\t \nProvider\nAveraged Monthly Service Cost based upon a two-year amortization of initial equipment \nFY 13-14 Estimated Annual Cost of Services \nAT&T Mobility\n$10,089.35\n$121,072.20\nSprint Solutions, Inc.\n$6,803.82\n$81,645.84\nVerizon Wireless\n$6,686.24\n$80,234.88\n\t \nSubmitted By:\nGina Bailey, Int.
