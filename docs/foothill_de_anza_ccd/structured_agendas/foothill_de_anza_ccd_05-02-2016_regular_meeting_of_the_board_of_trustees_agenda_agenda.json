These agents send students overseas to undertake their college and university study. Over the past eight years, we employed the services of this contractor, Gregory Barattini, who helped us to significantly increase the number of relationships we maintain with agents all over China, Indonesia, the rest of Southeast Asia and Europe. This expansion was a strong factor in past years in the District being able to increase international student enrollment \u00a0despite the very challenging economic environment. In addition, the contractor helped reduce the District's travel expenses by representing us at many international study abroad fairs and exhibitions.\n\t\u00a0\nThis contract would extend the services of Gregory Barattini for a one-year period starting July 1st. Mr. Barattini is a recognized professional expert and is one of few individuals known to the Foothill and De Anza International Programs Offices who provides this kind of international student recruitment representation to colleges and universities. For years, he worked as the senior vice president for marketing at several large international language school chains, recently represented Santa Monica College in a similar capacity over a four-year period, and has done an excellent job for Foothill-De Anza\u00a0Community College District in past years. His clients also include Berkeley Colleges in New York City and UCLA Extension. He fully understands what the District has to offer and how to market us abroad, and is on a first-name \u00a0basis with a very large number of advising agents around the world. In addition, he is physically located in Indonesia, which allows him to travel inexpensively throughout the region and saves us considerable expenses.\n\t\u00a0\nThe contractor will provide year-round recruitment representation in Southeast and South Asia, in Turkey and in Scandinavia. Specifically, he will:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Develop relationships for Foothill-De Anza with additional new educational \u00a0advising agents;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthen \u00a0relationships with existing agents;\n\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provide representation \u00a0at large study abroad fairs and agent seminars; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provide ongoing recruitment and international marketing advice.\n\t\u00a0\nThe contractor will provide these services to Foothill-De Anza and to one or two other institutions, which will equally share in travel and related expenses. He will not represent any other community college.\n\t\u00a0\nThe contractor will be paid $3,800.00 per month and will invoice us for the District's share of his travel expenses, which will not exceed $95,600.00 for the academic year.\n\t\u00a0\nSubmitted by:\nKimberlee Messina, Interim President Foothill College\nAdditional contact names:\nVinita Bali, Dean, International Student Programs\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t\u00a0\n",
