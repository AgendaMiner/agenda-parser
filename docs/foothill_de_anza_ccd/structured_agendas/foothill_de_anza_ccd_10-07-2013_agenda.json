At the end of Fall Quarter instruction and prior to the holiday break the furniture in the existing spaces will need to be removed and some of the spaces will be reconfigured to accommodate Winter Quarter classroom requirements. \n\t \nPurchasing Services staff met with De Anza campus representatives and Plant Services representatives to coordinate a plan to remove the furniture and dispose of it. In an effort to best utilize District resources and expedite the process in the most efficient manner, Purchasing Services recommends that, in the best interest of the District and in the most charitable and environmentally sound way practical, the furniture be sold, donated, recycled or disposed of on-site.   Purchasing Services will attempt to donate usable furniture first to other public entitles, then to charitable organizations.  If the furniture cannot be donated then Purchasing Services will sell the furniture.  Any remaining furniture will be recycled or disposed of.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Interim Director, Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nEric Olague, Buyer, Purchasing Services\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

This agreement for lease of unneeded space to construct an on-site branch is in response to student interest, particularly financial aid recipients, in having banking options that are currently not available to many De Anza students.  US Bank has been chosen because of their unique experience and commitment to establishing mini-branch banks with services to students on 33 college campuses across the country. De Anza students will benefit from free checking (4 years) and other banking services, with access to a wide network of ATM’s.\n\t \nThe proposed lease is for approximately 350 square feet of space located in the college bookstore at De Anza College which is not needed for academic activities and within which US Bank will build out and operate a full service branch bank to meet the needs of interested students and staff. A copy of the Lease Agreement is attached. \n\t \nExplanation of Lease Rate and Methodology to Determine Fair Market Value. The  base rent is $10,000 per year enhanced by several tangible and intangible factors which increase the value to the District, and which more than satisfy our understanding of fair market value in these unique circumstances. The District/College and US Bank are in agreement that the annual compensation, in addition to the services/benefits provided to the college community by the US Bank on-site branch, in exchange for the modest square footage of space provided in the bookstore facility reasonably equates to fair market value for the space being leased. In addition, the $2,500 annual student scholarship being provided by the bank, the financial literacy workshops planned for students given by bank staff and the fact that US Bank will operate the branch at its sole cost significantly enhances the tangible and in-kind value being provided by US Bank in exchange for use of the space in the De Anza college bookstore.\n\t \nCode Compliance. The three-week public notice required by Education Code section 81378.1(b) has been given in a newspaper of general circulation.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPresident Brian Murphy  x8705\nAdditional contact names:\nLetha Jeanpierre, Vice President Finance and Educational Resources x8976\nDonna Jones-Dulin, Associate Vice President of  Finance and Educational Resources x8209\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Only two bids were received and the lowest responsive bid price received was 14.8% over the construction budget.  The board was advised that District staff would revise the scopes of work and rebid the work in the future. The site work for the modular trailers was completed in Project #105 and the District Office Building Swing Space project to renovate the trailers was awarded on May 13, 2013; that work is now substantially complete and District staff will relocate to the modular trailers while construction on the District Office Building is underway.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nAdditionally, at its March 4, 2013 meeting, the Board of Trustees accepted a list of fourteen (14) contractors who met all of the prequalification requirements as the only direct contractors who are “prequalified” to bid on the Measure E Project #420 – District Office Building Renovation.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nThe District Office Building Renovation project consists of an interior renovation of existing space including flooring and finishes; removal and disposal of old materials that is of not required for school purposes pursuant to Education Code 81656; bathroom renovations; mechanical, electrical, plumbing infrastructure improvements; fire alarm improvements; and telecommunications upgrades. The project will also include some site work in the adjacent areas.  Cody Anderson Wasney Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nBid #1348-420R was legally advertised on August 13 and August 20, 2013.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the Daily Pacific Builder, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Eight (8) of the fourteen (14) pre-qualified contractors attended the mandatory job walk on August 27, 2013 and six (6) of those contractors submitted bids.  Bids were publicly opened and read on September 18, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. by Purchasing Services. The bid results are shown below:\n\t\t\t\t\t \n CONTRACTOR\n BASE  BID          AMOUNT\n Alten Construction, Inc.\n $2,938,000\n D. L.

Griffin, Inc.\n $3,074,000\n Zolman Construction and Development, Inc.\n $3,560,000\n\t\t\t\t\t \nThe lowest responsive and responsible bidder is Alten Construction, Inc. (Alten). Alten successfully completed projects for other public agencies including the modernization of the Chinese Immersion School at De Avila in San Francisco, the College of Marin Indian Valley Transportation Technology Complex modernization, and the Merritt College Learning Center Library renovation.  Furthermore, Alten and its listed subcontractors have each signed the “Agreement To Be Bound” and the “Agreement of Contractors” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.  \n\t\t\t\t\t \nThe bid price of $2,938,000 as submitted by Alten exceeded the construction estimate of  $2,600,000 but is within the expected bid range.

A patient simulator manikin recording and debriefing system captures the live simulation.  After the training scenario is completed, students and instructors can review the recorded sessions in a remote debriefing room.  The recording and debriefing system will fully integrate with manikin patients in two simulated hospital rooms.  The program requires one additional adult manikin, software, accessories, equipment, warranty, and training to create two simulated hospital rooms with manikin patients. \n \nThe District Purchasing Services Department prepared bid documents and incorporated technical specifications jointly written with De Anza College staff for the purchase of the Nursing Patient Simulation System for the Nursing Program.  The technology equipment required to fully integrate and operate the manikins in the teaching environment are included in Invitation to Bid (ITB) #1473.\n \nITB #1474 was advertised in the San Jose Post Record on August 9, 2013 and August 16, 2013.  The ITB was sent to three (3) vendors, as well as, posted on “BidNet” at  www.govbids.com.  Purchasing Services staff publicly opened and read the bids on September 6, 2013 at 2 PM.  The bid results are shown below:\n \n \nCAE Healthcare\nLaerdal\nGrand Total\n$106,643.35\n$121,645.00\n \nDe Anza staff evaluated the METIman Nursing Patient Simulation system proposed by CAE Healthcare and determined that it does meet or exceed the ITB specifications and the program requirements.  In addition, Purchasing Services contacted six (6) references provided by CAE Healthcare who all identified that they were satisfied with CAE Healthcare as a vendor and verified that its proposed METIman patient simulators worked well in a teaching environment.  As provided in the bid instructions, the award will be made to the responsive and responsible bidder who offered the lowest grand total on the bid forms. Therefore, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is CAE Healthcare.\n \nThe project is funded from Nursing Alumni Association and Measure C FF&E.  The Nursing Alumni Association will fund certain costs such as on-site installation, an extended warranty, and a manikin loaner repair service that are not allowed by Measure C; that portion of the bid is a total of $9,500. The Measure C budget for the project is $235,000 and the aggregate total costs of ITB #1473 and ITB #1474 is well under that amount.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Gina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing Services, ext 6165\nAdditional contact names:\n Letha Jeanpierre, Edward Breault, Jean Burke, Dawn Allshouse\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",
