It is relevant to note that this is not new, additional funding to the District. The $23 million is a re-designation of what the District would have received in general state apportionment and prevented the district from experiencing approximately $7 million more in cuts to our overall funding. The District will apply these re-designated funds as needed to the instructional and student support categories included in the spending plan until the amount received from the EPA is reached. No funds will be applied to administrator’s salaries or benefits, or any other administrative costs. The District will post on its website an accounting of what the final 2012-13 allocation of EPA funds was to the District and how it was expended. This will not take place until late September after the financial books for 2012-13 have been closed. Additionally the expenditure of the funds will be included in the CCFS-311 report to the state chancellor’s office and the annual financial audit will include verification that the funds were used as required by Proposition 30.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nKevin McElroy x6201\nAdditional contact names:\nJoni Hayes Lamprey x6261\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

(TouchNet) to provide an on-line student credit card payment authorization plan; this plan allows our students to pay their tuition and fees on-line through an easy-to-use payment gateway service. This service authenticates the student’s credit card payment with his/her banking institution and records the payment transactions; the transaction history reconciles with the Banner student accounts on a daily basis.  The current annual cost is $21,840.50.  The District successfully processed approximately $48.6 million dollars of student tuition and fees, per year, through the current payment gateway service.\n\t \nRequest to add the additional student installment plan and electronic checking service components:\nBased on the request from both colleges to help meet the registration payment needs of the students, the District’s ETS staff requests to add two additional service components to the current credit card payment gateway service from TouchNet.  The First Addendum to the Application Subscription Program Agreement would extend the original services for an additional five years and include the additional service components.\n        1. The installment plan will provide service to the students who cannot pay tuition and fees all at once, at the time of registration; students can elect to enroll in a self-service payment plan by this service, they will have the opportunity to divide their payments into pre-defined schedules and pay off the balance gradually.\n        2. The additional electronic checking component will provide service to students and parents, who do not have a credit card; an alternative way to pay tuition and fees directly from their checking accounts (ACH transctions).\nThe total annual cost for the added components plus the original payment gateway will be $73,825 (subject to an annual escalation not to exceed 5%), and is prorated for May and June 2013 at a cost of $3,822.  A one-time implementation and set-up cost for the additional components will be $31,575.  Total cost for implementation and license fee through June 30, 2014 will be $109,222.\n\t \nAnalysis:\nTouchNet has provided electronic payment services to the District for many years. They process all of our credit card payments from students over the web.   Over those years TouchNet has become deeply embedded in the District’s information systems, particularly since we have implemented the Banner Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  In addition, ETS staff has spent considerable time and effort making sure that all our ecommerce transactions through TouchNet are fully compliant with PCI-DSS (credit card security) standards.  \n\t \nETS now wish to add additional e-commerce options for students – a self-service payment plan administration and ACH transaction (electronic checks) processing. These services are available from TouchNet. Payment processing systems are available from other vendors; however, they are not compatible with the currently installed payment-processing infrastructure we operate. If the District were to prepare a bid specification for the two additional service components, only TouchNet would be a responsive bidder.  This is because:\nIn order to provide consistent service to students and manageable functionality for support staff, all ecommerce payment functions need to be provided through a single user interface.  Essentially, all services must come from the same vendor. \nDue to significant technical and funding constraints we really cannot consider removing existing TouchNet services to migrate to another vendor.   \nAdditionally, Ellucian (maker of the Banner system) has recently announced that TouchNet is their primary partner for electronic payment processing services.  Subsequently, the District will receive the highest level of support for payment processing integration by staying with TouchNet.\n\t \nThere are also a couple of other features that are unique to the services provided by TouchNet that other vendors do not have:  \n1.)  TouchNet does not charge students a fee for payment plan processing, whereas other vendors do not provide this option, and \n2.)  All of TouchNet’s transaction processing is done in real time which makes it easier for technical and functional staff to reconcile student payments.  Other vendors only offer nightly batch processing.\n\t \nIn view of the complexity and impacts it may cause to replace the current exiting contract for the payment gateway service, and to add associated components by another vendor, ETS requests the board’s approval to enter a sole source contract to include the additional installment plan and electronic checking services to our existing agreement, and extend the TouchNet contract for another five (5) years.\nThe First Addendum to the Application Subscription Program agreement and the request to enter into a contract without conducting a competitive bid process was reviewed by District legal counsel, Mr. John Shupe of Lynch and Shupe, LLP.  Mr. Shupe supports the approval of this board action item based upon the facts and information provided by the Educational Technology Services department.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJoe Moreau, Vice Chancellor of Technology, x6120\nAdditional contact names:\nChien Shih, Director of Information Systems & Operations, x 6139\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

The meals are based on an 11-day menu cycle required by the State of California.  The CDC serves a culturally diverse population, and menus that reflect the range of cultures are preferred.  Fresh foods are emphasized.  Dietary restrictions due to allergy, disability, or religion are accommodated.  \n \nThe Invitation to Bid 1626 was advertised on February 4, 2013 and February 11, 2013.  The bid was sent to six (6) vendors and it was also posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com. Bids were due on March 11, 2013.  Only one bid was received. The current contractor, Bigbreak LLC, dba Chefables, submitted the bid.  Chefables has been providing meals for the CDC since August 1, 2012.  The CDC has been happy with Chefables performance and the quality of the meals that are being served to the children.  Both the CDC and Chefables have been working towards a common goal of having high quality and nutritious food being served.  Chefables also provides food delivery services to other public agencies in the Bay Area including College of San Mateo and San Francisco State Head Start.\n \nThe total annual FY 13-14 expenditure for breakfasts, lunches, and snacks will be $115,500 based upon the bid price submitted from Chefables.  The flat fee prices are firm during the first year and any price adjustment after the first year (if the contract is renewed) shall be negotiated. Compared to the prices currently being paid, this bid results in over an 11% reduction in the prices of meals and snacks.  The State of California provides approximately $30,000 in reimbursement funds annually for this program.  The balance of the funding comes from private-fee based tuitions, as well as State of California child development subsidies.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Gina Bailey, Interim Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Dawn Allshouse, Senior Buyer and Naoko Harada, Director Childcare Center\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",

Only two bids were received and the lowest responsive bid price received was 14.8% over the construction budget.  The board was advised that District staff would revise the scopes of work and rebid the work in the future. The site work for the modular trailers was completed in Project #105 and the District Office Building Renovation project will bid in early summer.  Construction is expected to start in early fall.\n\t \nThis project, the District Office Building (DOB) Swing Space, consists of an interior renovation of existing modular buildings including demolition; framing; drywall; flooring, finishes; mechanical, electrical, plumbing infrastructure; bathroom; fire alarm; and telecommunications. The project will also include some site work in the adjacent areas.\n\t \nCody Anderson Wasney Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department.\n\t \nBid #1348-420A was legally advertised on February 19 and February 26, 2013.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the Daily Pacific Builder, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Bids were publicly opened and read on April 2, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. by Purchasing Services.  The bid results are shown below:\n\t \nCONTRACTOR\nBASE BID AMOUNT\nCalstate Construction, Inc.\n$515,000\nRC Benson & Sons, Inc.\n$541,284\nHallmark Construction\n$557,700\nBeals Martin and Associates, Inc.\n$564,687\nB Bros Construction, Inc.\n$583,660\nHoi’s Construction Inc.\n$616,000\nRomkon, Inc.\n$695,000\nRodan Builders Inc.\n$708,000\n\t \nThe lowest responsive and responsible bidder is Calstate Construction, Inc. Calstate Construction, Inc. successfully completed Project #109 – PE Lab Space Remodel at Foothill College, Project #247 – G Building at De Anza College, and also Project #252/100F – Elevator Repairs for both Foothill and De Anza colleges.\n\t \nThe bid price of $515,000 as submitted by Calstate Construction, Inc. is well within the architect’s construction estimate of $791,805 and the construction budget of $792,000. In addition, an addendum that simplified the electrical specification reduced the cost of that portion of the work by $40-50,000. As anticipated, bidding the DOB Swing Space separately from the District Office Renovation resulted in lower bids for the swing space renovation than those received when the two were bid together.  The project will be constructed with Measure E funds.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.

The satellite dish and its associated buildings (1020, 1021, 1022) in the southwest corner of the site at the intersection of Innovation Way and W. Moffett Park Drive will not be demolished.  \n\t \nThe proportionate costs of demolition design, project management, demolition, related consultants, and Measure C overhead will be reimbursed to the District by the City, at a cost not to exceed $400,000.  The District’s estimated cost for the work is $290,000.  However, the District agrees to defer the City’s payment of its Proportionate Share until three (3) years after the date of this Agreement or upon the sale of Parcel D by the City to a third party, whichever event occurs earlier.  This agreement does not include any interest payments on the loan in recognition of the mutual benefit of prompt development of site to both the District and the City, in recognition of the multiple upcoming coordination and cooperation opportunities that will be required between the District and the City as the site is developed to its full potential, and in recognition of the very low interest rates that would be applicable to such a loan.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nCharles Allen, Executive Director, Facilities, Operations, and Construction Management,  extension 6150\nAdditional contact names:\nKevin McElroy x 6201, Art Heinrich x 6295\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Also attached is a series of floor plans that show the program changes by floor.\n\t \nThe changes for the program moves were developed in a coordinated effort led by the De Anza College VP for Instruction who directed the various moves based on the phase out of Business / Computer Systems (Digital Imaging) due to budget cuts.  Once the moves were confirmed, a series of meetings with the Deans and program staff were held to determine student load, functionality, furniture, and equipment layout (computer and electric) needs. Floor plans were developed by College staff based on this information and reviewed and confirmed with Deans.  A few additional changes were identified when program staff realized that they were going to have to function differently because of the loss of specific staff.  Also, included with the above are the desires of the new Dean of Business - Business / Computer System’s to have the computer lab space on the 2nd floor function differently than previously envisioned.  These changes included floor plan changes with some spaces re-purposed for different functions and the inclusion of multiple large LCD monitors.\n\t \nOn the 3rd floor, Student Success (a unit under Learning Resources) took over space previously occupied by Business / Computer Systems  (Digital Imaging).  With the exception of the Math, Science, Technology Resource Center in S-4, all of Student Success will now be consolidated on the 3rd floor of the ATC.  \n\t \nPCO#004 – In response to CCD#11, contractor was issued CCD#004 to proceed with ordering electrical and data materials, to begin installation of any required backing, and to modify electrical and data installations in order to help minimize potential schedule impacts.  Total costs not-to-exceed $50,000 - OD\n\t \nPCO#005 – Revisions required to accommodate all of the program changes in the building that were identified after initial contract award.   The total cost of this change is $129,626 which includes an allowance in the amount of $38,000 for unidentified work that may be directed by Architect and a twenty-three (23) calendar day non-compensable schedule extension - OD \n\t \nPCO#006 – Wall Covering Stair#1                $6,798 - OD\n\t \nThe total Change Orders to date represent 3.97% against the original contract amount.  Funding is included in the current budget.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nCharles Allen, Executive Director, Facilities, Operations, and Construction Management,  extension 6150\nAdditional contact names:\nTom Armstrong, Director, Bond Program Management, De Anza College\nDonna Jones-Dulin, Associate Vice President, Finance & Educational Resources, De Anza College\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

OC Jones is currently completing the De Anza College Stadium & Track project.\n\t \nThe plans and specifications for Alternate #1 – Lot 1 bridge, entrance, and traffic signal are not fully approved by the Division of State Architect (DSA).  However, DSA approval is anticipated soon as its review is near completion.  If the scope of work for Alternate #1 does not get approved by May 22, 2013 then that particular scope of work must be placed on hold until next summer.  The Measure C bond team recommends award a contract for the Base Bid Proposal Amount plus Alternate #1 (contingent upon DSA approval, but only if DSA approval is achieved by May 22, 2013), Alternate #2 and Alternate #3. Alternate #4 should not be accepted because a concrete sidewalk is preferable to the decomposed granite sidewalk and it has a longer lifespan.  Upon receipt of a Notice of Award on May 14, 2013, the awarding bidder will be instructed to obtain insurances and bonds in the aggregate amount of the Base Bid Proposal Amount plus Alternate #1, Alternate #2, and Alternate #3.  If DSA approval for Alternate #1 is not obtained by May 22, 2013, the District shall credit back the difference in insurance and bond premium costs for Alternate #1 as a deductive change order.\n\t \nDistrict Purchasing Staff reviewed the award procedure for Alternate #1 with the Foothill College Bond Director, Mr. Art Heinrich and District’s legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret.  Mr. Jaret supports the decision of the District staff to proceed with the recommendation for the Board of Trustees to award Alternate #1, but only contingent upon DSA approval by May 22,2013. The Notice to Proceed will only include the work for Alternate #1 if DSA approval is received by that date.\n\t \nThe bid price of $4,062,000 for the Base Bid plus Alternates #1 - #3 submitted by OC Jones is slightly over the aggregate construction estimate of $4,000,000 for the work is and it is within the overall Project #162 budget for all phases of work. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.
