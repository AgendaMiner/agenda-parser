The specific requirements in the SCSSA may be found in California Education Code, Sections 78210-78219. By prompting each California Community Colleges to write a 3SP plan, the legislature’s intent is to “increase California community college student access and success by providing effective core matriculation services, including orientation, assessment and placement, counseling, and other educational planning services, and academic interventions.” Consistent with the premise that student success is the responsibility of not only the student, but also of the institution as a whole, the overriding goal is for colleges to outline a specific plan to provide evidence-based, well-coordinated services that are integrated throughout both student services and instruction. Our efforts to increase student success must also give particular attention to at-risk students and to identifying and addressing issues of equity and disproportionate impact. With these principles in mind, we will coordinate with the Basic Skills and Student Equity Workgroups and the academic, classified, and student senates to develop a framework for cross-campus collaboration and coordination. We also realize that it will be imperative to actively include our part-time employees – whether they are faculty or staff – if our efforts are to be successful.\n\t \nWe continue to work with our office of institutional research to evaluate the effectiveness of our efforts and revise our 3SP plan as appropriate in an ongoing effort to increase student success. This includes analysis through program review and other practices to gather data and evaluate outcomes with respect to orientation, assessment and placement, education plans, interventions for at-risk students, and follow-ups. \n\t \nThe current credit 3SP plan for 2015-2016 is attached.  It is a draft in that the Planning and Resource Council (PaRC) will not be able to meet and approve the plan until October 7, 2015, at the earliest.  The noncredit 3SP plan will be presented for the governing board's information at the November meeting.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nLaureen Balducci, Associate Vice President of Student Services, Foothill College\nAdditional contact names:\nDenise Swett, VP Student Services; Carolyn Holcroft, Academic Senate President\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Purchasing Services staff and Jon Rubin, Foothill College Director of Business and Education Partnerships evaluated the response.
