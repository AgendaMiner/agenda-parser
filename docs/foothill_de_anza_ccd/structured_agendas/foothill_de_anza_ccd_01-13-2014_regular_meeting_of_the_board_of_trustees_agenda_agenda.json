The District received responses from two bidders – Laerdale Medical Corporation (Laerdale) and CAE Healthcare (CAE). Laerdale submitted a bid for the exact system specified by the District and CAE submitted a bid for a system that was stated to meet or exceed the District’s specifications. CAE was determined to be the lowest responsive and  responsible bidder by the District, and on October 7, 2013, the BOT authorized the award of ITB#1474 to CAE in the amount of $106,643.35. \n\t \nOn October 10, 2013, the District received a protest letter from Laerdale, the unsuccessful bidder. The protest letter claimed that the awarded product offered by CAE did not fully meet the requirements listed in the District’s bid document. The protest letter was received by the Purchasing Services Department prior to a purchase order being issue to CAE.\n\t \nAfter receiving the protest letter, and seeking the advice of the District’s legal counsel John Shupe, the District provided CAE with the opportunity to identify in writing how its product meets or exceeds each of the areas that were identified as non-conforming in the bid protest letter. CAE responded and stated that its product conforms to all specifications listed in the protest letter with the exception of diaphoresis, ear secretions, and circumoral cyanosis. The exceptions were not listed in CAE’s bid documents as required in section 1.04.\n\t \nBased on the new information of the exceptions the Purchasing Department, together with the Nursing Department, reevaluated the bids and determined that CAE’s system does not meet the minimum specifications as required, and to that extent its bid is non-responsive.\n\t \nAfter reviewing the documents and sequence of events with the District’s legal counsel John Shupe, the Director of Purchasing Services sent a letter to CAE Healthcare informing the company of the recommendations that will be taken to the Board of Trustees. The letter requested a response by December 2, 2013, and no response was received.    \n\t \nThe amount of this purchase that will be funded through Measure C FF&E is $110,249.75 and the extended warranty amount of $11,395.25 will be funded from the Nursing Alumni Association.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nDr. Anita Muthyala-Kandula, Dean of Biology, Health, Environmental Sciences and Workforce Development \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
