In August 2014, the District refunded a portion of the Prior Bonds.\n\t \nThe District now desires to refinance portions of the callable Prior Bonds, in particular, the current interest bonds maturing in 2031, through the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds in an aggregate principal amount of not-to-exceed $110,000,000.  All the benefits of refunding must be given to the local taxpayers; the District will not receive any money from the transaction.  In addition, the final maturity of the Refunding Bonds will not exceed the final maturity date of the Prior Bonds.\n \n(a)        Bond Resolution.  This Resolution authorizes the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds (the “Refunding Bonds”), in one or more series of federally taxable and federally tax-exempt bonds.  The resolution specifies the basic terms, parameters and forms of the Bonds, and approves the forms of Purchase Contract, Escrow Agreement and Preliminary Official Statement described below.  The Bonds are only authorized to be issued as current interest bonds.  Capital appreciation bonds are not authorized.  In particular, Section 1 of the Resolution establishes the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds issued ($110,000,000).  Section 4 of the Resolution states the maximum underwriting discount (1.0%) with respect to the Refunding Bonds, and authorizes the Refunding Bonds to be sold at a negotiated sale to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”).\n \n(b)        Form of Purchase Contract.  Pursuant to the Purchase Contract, the Underwriter will agree to buy the Refunding Bonds from the District.  All the conditions of closing the transaction are set forth in this document, including the documentation to be provided at the closing by various parties.  Upon the pricing of the Refunding Bonds, the final execution copy of the Purchase Contract will be prepared following this form.\n\t \n(c)        Form of Preliminary Official Statement.  The Preliminary Official Statement (“POS”) is the offering document describing the Bonds which may be distributed to prospective purchasers of the Bonds.  The POS discloses information with respect to among other things (i) the proposed uses of proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the terms of the Bonds (interest rate, redemption terms, etc.), (iii) the bond insurance policy for the Bonds, if any, (iv) the security for repayment of the Bonds (the tax levy), (v) information with respect to the District’s tax base (upon which such ad valorem taxes may be levied), (vi) District financial and operating data, (vii) continuing disclosure with respect to the Bonds and the District, and (viii) absence of litigation and other miscellaneous matters expected to be of interest to prospective purchasers of the Bonds.  Following the pricing of the Bonds, a final Official Statement for the Bonds will be prepared, substantially in the form of the POS.\n\t \n(d)        Form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate.  The form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate can be found in APPENDIX C to the POS.  Effective July 3, 1995, all underwriters of municipal bonds, are obligated to procure from a bond issuer a covenant that such public agency will annually file “material financial information and operating data with respect to the District” through the web-based Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system maintained by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (which is the federal agency that regulates “broker-dealers,” including investment bank firms that underwrite municipal obligation issuances).  This requirement is expected to be satisfied by the filing of the District’s audited financial statements and other operating information about the District, in the same manner the District has filed in connection with prior bond issuances.  The purpose of the law is to provide investors in the Refunding Bonds with current information regarding the District.  Similar laws have governed the corporate debt market for many years.\n\t \n (e)       Escrow Agreement.  Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds in an amount sufficient to redeem the outstanding Prior Bonds will be deposited in an escrow fund (the “Escrow Fund”) held by U.S. Bank National Association (acting as “Escrow Agent”).  The monies in the Escrow Fund will be used by the Escrow Agent to refund portions of the 2006 Series A Bonds and 2006 Series B Bonds on August 1, 2017.  As a result of the deposit and application of funds so provided in the Escrow Agreement, the Prior Bonds will be defeased and the obligation of Santa Clara County to levy ad valorem taxes for payment of the Prior Bonds will cease.  \n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT\n\t \nThere is no fiscal impact to the General Fund resulting from the issuance of the Bonds. \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION\n\t \nStaff recommends approval of Resolution # 2015-07, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF THE FOOTHILL-DE ANZA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT (SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA) 2015 GENERAL OBLIGATION REFUNDING BONDS.\n\t \nSee attached Executive Summary for more detail.\n\t \n         Vice Chancellor of Business Services, Kevin McElroy recommends that the Board:\n\t \n           1.  Approve Resolution No. 2015-07 authorizing Issuance of 2015 General Obligation Refunding Bonds\n\t \n           2.  Approve the form of the Preliminary Official Statement\n\t \n           3.  Approve the form of the Purchase Contract and;\n\t \n           4.  Approve the form of the Escrow Agreement.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6202\nAdditional contact names:\n Hector Quinonez, Executive Director, Fiscal Services, x6250\n Joni Hayes, Director, Budget Operations, x6261\nIs backup provided?\n Yes\n\t \n",

The initiative was born out of communications deficiencies identified during the 9/11 attacks. An interoperable radio system where all public safety agencies could share critical information was made a national priority. Both Santa Clara and Sunnyvale departments have moved to the new system this past year and more agencies will migrate as additional infrastructure comes on line.  It is anticipated that the District will join the new system when coverage becomes available to both campuses.\n\t \nThe District's Police Department is part of the County Mutual Aid Master Plan and can be called upon to respond to any major emergency. The ability to communicate with our mutual aid partners is essential. Additionally, the new Foothill Education Center is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2016 and the District's officers will need to communicate with Sunnyvale DPS in emergency situations.\n\t \nIn response to requests from the cities of Santa Clara and Sunnyvale to initiate implementation of the Silicon Valley Regional Communications System (SVRCS), the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Authority (SVRIA) undertook a vendor solicitation and selection process. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was prepared and a twelve member RFP team was established, representing seven cities, the county, and SVRIA. \n\t \nThe District's existing mobile and portable radios are eleven years old and at the end of their life cycle. The radios are no longer supported by the manufacturer and cannot be repaired. Because the estimated cost to replace the radios will exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $86,000, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking”.  The agreement SVRIA Contract is available and it includes the items required by the District. \n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the prices offered on the County of Santa Clara contract for the same goods and services. The contract establishes discounts for police radios and related equipment.\n\t \nThe estimated amount is $120,000 to be funded by General Fund, Central Services Safety and Security.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\nKevin McElroy, Ron Levine, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

The GMP was established based upon the DSA-approved set of drawings and specifications. \n\t \nSwinerton Builders’ GMP for this project is $2,734,249.  The scope of work includes renovating the L-7 exterior façade; renovating the classrooms interiors; upgrading power and HVAC to the building; re-roofing the flat and tile roofs with new flashings, stucco, and performance coatings; new interior and exterior painting; fire alarm upgrades; lighting upgrades, replacing indicated doors; infilling specific windows; new chair rails or re-painting of chair rails, new IDF room with data backbone, accessibility upgrades at exterior entrances, and miscellaneous interior upgrades as shown on the Contract Documents. The L-7 Renovation project is funded by Measure C.\n\t \nDistrict Staff recommends that the Board of Trustees award the Site Lease and Facilities Lease agreements to Swinerton Builders to construct the project based upon DSA-approved construction documents for an amount not-to-exceed the GMP. Under the two agreements, the District will lease District-owned land to Swinerton Builders, and Swinerton Builders will agree to construct the Project pursuant to the District’s Construction Provisions and Swinerton Builders’ responses to RFQ/RFP 1678-202.  The District will receive incremental title to the constructed property in accordance with payments made.  The District will pay for and take title to all improvements no later than completion of construction of the Project, at which time the leases will be terminated. \n\t \nUpon execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease, Swinerton Builders will be given access to and control of the site to commence work.

(Calstate).  However, Calstate did not submit its signed Appendix A and Appendix C of the Project Stabilization Agreement (PSA) between the District and the Santa Clara and San Benito Counties Building Trades Council with its bid. The signed PSA documents were submitted to the Purchasing Services office prior to the end of bid opening day on March 5, 2015. \n \nPurchasing Services previously consulted with District’s legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret, regarding the failure of a Contractor to include the requisite signed PSA documents with its bid.  Mr. Jaret concluded that the failure to submit the required PSA documents is a minor irregularity that can and should be waived by the District if the Contractor later cured such deficiency shortly thereafter.  The failure not to provide the PSA documents with its bid does not provide a Contractor with any competitive advantage over the other bidders.  \n \nCalstate has completed several public works projects for the District including the Elevator Repairs at both campuses, G Building renovation project and the DOB Swing Space project.  Calstate and its listed subcontractors have each signed the “Agreement To Be Bound” and the “Agreement of Contractors” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.  \n \nThe bid price of $246,500 as submitted by Calstate Construction will be funded by  Measure C project #218.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services - x6166\nAdditional contact names:\n  Tom Armstrong - x8289, Steve Kitchen - x6150, Gina Bailey - x6165\nIs backup provided?\n  No\n\t \n",
