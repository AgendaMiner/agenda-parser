                    "item_details": "\nBackground and Analysis:\n\t \nCurrently, the District, when contracting for public works construction, is subject to Public Contract Code 20651, which states that “The Governing Board shall let any contract for a public project, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 22002, involving an expenditure of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or more to the lowest responsible bidder who shall give security as the Board requires, or else reject all bids.” This dollar limit has not been increased since the law was enacted in 1982 and causes significant challenges to the District for several reasons:\nThe bid threshold of $15,000 is so low that it limits the ability of the facilities department to contract for minor work on campus in a timely manner.\nOn many smaller projects, it is unknown whether the project will exceed the bid threshold; therefore, many times the District does not know until quotes come in whether the project requires formal bidding.\nProjects that are formally bid require that a detailed specification be written. This adds significant cost and time to smaller and simple projects with no increased benefit to the District.\nThe bid process for small projects, including architectural drawings, for formal bids can take up to six months. \nThe Board of Trustees meets once per month; therefore, work on smaller public works projects is delayed waiting for Board approval. This impacts projects with tight schedules related to work that must be performed during breaks.\nThere is a provision of Public Contract Code (Section 22000 et seq.) that allows a public agency to adopt the California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (CUPCCAA), enabling the District to increase the formal bid limits from $15,000 to $175,000, and create informal bidding procedures for projects from $45,000-$175,000.\n\t \nIf CUPCCAA is approved, public works projects will be administered as follows:\n\t \nProject Value\nDelivery Method \nComments \n$0-$45,000\nNo formal bid\nExempt from bidding requirements; these projects will be performed by negotiated contract, purchase order, or by our own forces. \n$45,000-$175,000\nInformal bidding procedures\nLet contract to the qualified contractor submitting the lowest quote through an informal bidding process. The District would still reserve the right to formally bid a project in this range if desired. Bid bonds, performance bonds, and payment bonds would continue to be required of all contractors doing work under these provisions.\nOver $175,000\nFormal bid \nNo substantial change from current bidding requirements.\n\t \nAs part of adopting CUPCCAA, the District would be required to maintain a list of qualified contractors according to the categories of work. The District is required to do contractor outreach on an annual basis and maintain the list. Contractors would be added to the list as requested during the course of the year. All qualified contractors from this list would be solicited on each informal bid between $45,000 and $175,000.\n\t \nAdopting this section of Public Contract Code will enable the District to more efficiently and effectively manage small to medium sized projects. There are currently 995 California government agencies that have implemented CUPCCAA of which 42 are community college districts such as, Cabrillo, Chabot-Las Positas, Contra Costa, San Mateo, and West Valley-Mission. A complete list can be found here, along with a comprehensive FAQ document prepared by the California State Controller’s Office.   \n\t \nThe Director of Purchasing Services will work with all stakeholders necessary to create informal bidding procedures to include a competitive component that aligns with current Administrative Procedures. The Vice Chancellor of Business Services, Executive Director of Fiscal Services, Executive Director of Facilities & Operations, and District legal counsel have been involved in this process and will continue to be involved until fully implemented. Once implemented, the District may, at any time, revert back to Public Contract Code 20651 by notifying the California State Controller's Office. \n\t \nThe Board of Trustees must adopt two resolutions to authorize the District to implement this higher bid threshold process. The purpose of this Board Information item is to provide the Trustees with advance background information about the CUPCCAA procedure. The appropriate resolutions will be included on the next regularly scheduled Board meeting agenda with a recommendation for approval.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Pam Grey, Director, Purchasing Services, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6201\n Steve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities & Operations, x6150\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",

A concise response that draws exact parallels to FHDA’s needs with a minimum use of boilerplate marketing material or overly technical language.\nReliability: A system that has a proven track record of reliability as well as an architecture that is inherently fault tolerant.   \nFunctionality: The ability for the system to improve how FHDA conducts its mission.  The efficiency and effectiveness of communications between all faculty, students, and staff at FHDA is critical to its long term success.\nCost Effectiveness: A cost effective solution in the initial purchase, as well as the ongoing maintenance and servicing of the system. What is deemed the best value.\nManufacturer Vision and Stability: Provider’s commitment to excellence in telecommunications equipment, financial stability, market share, and technological vision for the future.  \nVendor Experience: Evaluation of the Vendor's experience in the design and implementation of similar telecommunications systems and technologies, and Vendor reputation. Evaluation of Vendor’s ability to provide a structured, organized implementation that meets FHDA’s requirements.\nWarranty/Maintenance Support: Ability to provide timely support during the installation, warranty period, and ongoing maintenance.  \nETS and Purchasing Services have determined that AMS.NET Incorporated’s proposal is the best value to the District. The AMS.NET, Inc. bid proposal meets all the RFP #1737 mandatory requirements. AMS.NET, Inc. has completed similar projects for other agencies including West Hills Community College District, and Judicial Council of California.\n\t \nThe selected vendor will provide new telecommunications equipment, hardware and software, including necessary accessories and services, in the quantities that comply with the RFP document, subject to modification based upon the final design.   All pricing is turnkey and includes discovery, design, implementation, integration, testing, training, hardware and software. \n\t \nThe purchase price will be funded with Measure C Phone Equipment project #301 which includes hardware, software, installation labor, and year one-maintenance and support.  Years 2-5 of maintenance and support will be paid from Operational A-Budget funds.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nJoe Moreau, Sharon Luciw, Lisa Hocevar, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",
