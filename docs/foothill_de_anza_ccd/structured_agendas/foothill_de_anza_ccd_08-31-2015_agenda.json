On April 6, 2015, the Board approved Swinerton’s Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and authorized the District to enter into Lease Agreements to construct the L-7 Renovation project. Under the two Lease agreements, the District will lease District-owned land to Swinerton and in return Swinerton agreed to construct Phase 1 of the project pursuant to the District’s Construction Provisions and Swinerton’s responses to RFQ/RFP #1678-202. The District will receive incremental title to the constructed property in accordance with payments made. The District will pay for and take title to all improvements no later than completion of construction of the project at which time the leases will be terminated.\n\t \nOn May 4, 2015, the Board of Trustees (Board) approved Swinerton Builder’s Amendment #1 to the Preconstruction Services for the Phase 2 portion of the project. Swinerton will develop a Construction Schedule for bridging Phase 1 work with Phase 2, proceed with reviewing the Phase 2 design documentation for constructability, prequalify subcontractors for bidding, obtain competitive bids from subcontractors, and develop a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for Phase 2 of the project. Swinerton’s fee for Revision #1 to the Preconstruction Services for Phase 2 is $46,540. The Preconstruction Services Agreement, paragraph VII(C), provides that the contractor will be reimbursed at actual cost for reimbursable services and is defined (in Phase 2) as providing Subcontractor’s engineered design support for the replacement of the raised floors and for the replacement of the Halon fire suppression system – both of which require design completion along with submission and approvals from the Division of the State Architect (DSA). Swinerton proposed and District staff agreed that Swinerton’s reimbursable services for this effort is estimated at $7,500 but should not exceed $10,000.  The total not-to-exceed cost for the Preconstruction Services Agreement was established at $56,540.\n\t \nAmendment #2 to the Preconstruction Services adds costs for the design-assist portion of the Halon System and raised floor of the Phase 2 portion of the project. The added fee for Amendment #2 to the Preconstruction Services is $15,000 as a reimbursable fee. The additional costs are due to project schedule requirements and added criteria in scope.  Amendment #2 increases the Swinerton’s reimbursable services for this engineered design support effort by $15,000 making the total not-to-exceed value of $25,000 for this effort. \n\t \nThe budget has been established for the Phase 2 efforts and the value of the Preconstruction services by Swinerton is available within the Phase 2 budget. \n\t \nIf authorized by the Board, the District will provide and Swinerton will sign Amendment #2 to the Preconstruction Services Agreement and will commence working to complete design of the Halon Suppression System and raised floor and proceed with submission to the Department of the State Architect (DSA).\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nSteve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities and Operations\nAdditional contact names:\nDonna Jones Dulin, Associate Vice President - College Operations\nTom Armstrong, Director - Bond Program Management at De Anza College\n\t\t\t\t\tSteve Kitchen, Executive Director - Facilities and Operations\nAnnette Perez, Senior Buyer, Purchasing Services.\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",

The apparent low bidder is Calstate Construction, Inc. (Calstate) with a bid price of $1,191,110, which is $246,901 more than the estimate.  Calstate has confirmed that its bid price is true and accurate for the work as specified.  The added costs are most likely attributed to (1) data cabling routing and control panels inside of specific buildings and the inclusion of whole door replacements that were added to the scope of work, (2) the requirement for the work scheduled at CDC to be performed solely during evenings from 6:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m. and weekends, and (3) repair work to numerous door thresholds to meet current DSA requirements regarding the ADA access points and paths of travel to buildings that was added in the final design stages.\n\t \nAlthough, this project came in over the Architect’s estimated value and the allocated Measure C budget, it was planned that the Child Development Center and Campus Center would fund their portions of the construction costs. Because of the safety importance of the project, the Campus will provide additional funding (fund 400) to close the budget shortfall.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Steve Kitchen, Donna Jones Dulin, Tom Armstrong, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n  No\n\t \n",
