However, the district has not formalized through its policy a program of board development and orientation that includes specific expectations. Likewise, although trustees generally share informal reports of conferences attended at Board meetings and lately have submitted for the record written summaries of workshop participation, a mechanism for tracking progress on an ongoing basis has not been in place. To ensure that the district continues to meet or exceed standards for board development, a proposed policy regarding board education is attached for discussion. Also attached is a list of trustee professional development activities gleaned from 2013 Board meeting minutes and conference registrations that will be maintained going forward.\n\t \nDuring 2013, the Community College League of California (CCLC) introduced the Excellence in Trusteeship professional development program, which is intended to support good governance statewide as well as the efforts of individual districts to meet Accreditation Standard IV.B.1.f. Completion of the voluntary program is one way that trustees can provide evidence of ongoing professional development in areas identified by the CCLC as key competencies, including accreditation, student success, governance, fiscal responsibilities, board evaluation, ethics, and the Brown Act. Additionally, the ACCJC and the California Fair Political Practices Commission have accreditation and ethics workshops, respectively, available online at no charge.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nLinda Thor\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

The contracts covered many components in addition to Banner software including license and maintenance agreements for other software applications that integrate with Banner but are produced by different vendors. One software application was the Oracle database management system (Oracle DBMS), which is produced and licensed by the Oracle Corporation. The Banner system, a software application, requires integration with the Oracle DBMS to provide any and all of its functionality. The initial five-year Start-up Support / Maintenance Services Agreement approved by the board provided five years of services for all software products, except Oracle. Oracle was covered for only two years, through February 28, 2010.\n\t \nEvery two years, SunGardHE sends a contract amendment to the district to continue the Oracle maintenance agreement for an additional two-year period. Accordingly, on February 28, 2010, the district signed the first contract amendment to renew the Oracle maintenance agreement for two years. Since the merger of SungardHE and Datatel, the new corporation Ellucian also sent the second two years amendment for District board approval. The board also approved the second amendment of Oracle contract on May 7, 2012, to extend it to February 28, 2014.\n\t \nIn order to better align with the ending date of the original Banner master support contract the board approved on February 28, 2008, the district now requests board approval for this third amendment, which will provide maintenance for the Oracle DBMS software and related products for another four years, through February 2018, at a total cost of $1,227,552.\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nYear 7\nYear 8\nYear 9\nYear 10\nPeriod covered\nMarch 1, 2014\nto\nFebruary 28, 2015\nMarch 1, 2015\nto\nFebruary 28, 2016\nMarch 1, 2016\nto\nFebruary 28, 2017\nMarch 1, 2017\nto\nFebruary 28, 2018\nCost\n$289,076\n$300,639\n$312,665\n$325,172\n\t \nAs can be seen in the table above, the cost of the maintenance agreement increases by 4% a year but is also adjusted periodically for the size of the institution based on FTES.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJoseph Moreau, Vice Chancellor of Technology, x6120\nAdditional contact names:\nChien Shih, Director of Information Systems & Operations, x 6139\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Bids were publicly opened and read on January 10, 2014, at 3:00 p.m. by Purchasing Services.  One (1) contractor submitted a bid, R.C. Benson & Sons, Inc. General Contractors for the base bid amount of $93,820.\n\t \nThe bid price submitted by R.C. Benson & Sons, Inc. General Contractors exceeds the engineer’s estimate and the project budget of $70,000.  Also, receipt of only one bid for this work does not provide the assurance desired regarding adequate competitiveness.  Therefore, the District recommends that the Board reject the bid received for Bid #1674, Swim Center Cogeneration Heating Hot Water Modifications.  The District will work with Salas O’Brien Engineers to revise the scope and re-design the project for bidding at a later time. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nCharles Allen, Tom Armstrong, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",
