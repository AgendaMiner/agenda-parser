Brothers Company Inc.\n$134,380\nShank Electric\n$140,172\nNational Electric, Inc. \n$149,850\nARAM Electric, Inc. \n$151.000\nRosendin Electric, Inc.\n$155,980\nDelgado Electric, Inc.\n$162,500\nJoseph Cumiskey Construction Corp. \n$168,000\nAtlas/Pellizzari Electric, Inc.\n$179,000\nBASS Electric\n$181.375\n\t \n\t \nThe apparent low bidder, E.R. Brothers Company Inc. (ER Brothers) did not acknowledge receipt of Amendment #1 and did not submit its bid on the revised bid proposal form issued as a part of Amendment #1.  The bid document states in Document 00 21 13, Instructions to Bidders, Item #10 - District's Right to Modify Bid Documents, “the failure of any Bidder to acknowledge such amendments in its Bid Proposal will render the Bid Proposal non-responsive and rejected.”   The second apparent low bidder, Shank Electric’s contractor license was not valid at the time of the bid opening.  The bid document states in Document 00 21 13, Instructions to Bidders, Item #17 - Contractor’s License,  “No Bid Proposal will be considered from a Bidder who, at the time Bid Proposals are opened, is not licensed to perform the Work of the Contract Documents, in accordance with the Contractors License Law, California Business & Professions Code §§7000 et seq.  This requirement is not a mere formality and will not be waived by the District or its Board of Trustees.”  \n\t \nDistrict staff consulted with its legal counsel Mr. Phillip Jaret of Jaret & Jaret Attorneys at Law regarding these issues and it is the opinion of staff and legal counsel that ER Brothers not acknowledging the amendment and Shank Electric's license being suspended are not minor irregularities that can be waived.  Therefore, the bid proposals submitted by ER Brothers and Shank Electric must be rejected as non-responsive. \n\t \nThe apparent third lowest responsive and responsible bidder is National Electric, Inc. (National).   National acknowledged Amendment #1, however National did not submit its bid on the Revised Bid Proposal form issued as part of Amendment #1.   Purchasing Services consulted with District’s legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret, regarding the bid submitted on the incorrect form and it is his opinion that the failure of National to submit its pricing on the incorrect form does not make any material changes to the bid pricing, therefore, it is a minor irregularity that can be waived by the District.  \n\t \nNational has successfully completed projects for other public entities such as the City of Hayward, Leitch Elementary School and Azevada Elementary School. \n\t \nThe bid price of $149,850 submitted by National Electric Inc. is within the construction estimate of $195,500.  This project will be funded by Proposition 39: California Clean Energy Jobs Act, Year 1 and Year 2 Funding\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nSteve Kitchen, Jennifer Mahato, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

These ducts were part of the original building construction and they are beyond their useful life. Due to this type of ductwork, the Architect has advised that replacing all of the existing duct at the 2nd floor would be the most cost effective and prudent long-term option.  \n\t \nDue to the expedited nature of this work, the time allowed for the project team to request authorization from the Board of Trustees for authorization to negotiate change orders in excess of $50,000 has been extremely constrained. This Board of Trustees action item requests that the Board approve the project team to continue with negotiations with the Contractor to confirm the fixed costs and determine if any additional time is allowable to extend the duration of this new work in the project schedule, or, to request a specific amount of overtime to bring the project back on the approved scheduled completion.\n\t \nTo date, the Architectâs design team developed plans for the removal and replacement of the duct and the project team has been negotiating the best approach to perform the work with the Contractor as well as the cost component. The project completion date has been set at July 12, 2015, and does not allow for a schedule impact without negatively affecting the College operations. Change Order #2 is being presented in the amount of $658,565 for procurement and complete installation of the new duct only and no time extension is included in this Change Order #2. The Contractor will provide a time impact analysis schedule for review by the project team to determine if the contract completion date shall be extended or if overtime is necessary. The project team will negotiate added costs if necessary to bring the schedule back to the July 12, 2015, date. This Change Order #2 that covers PCO #9 is also based on the Contractor and their subcontractor not working overtime to complete this additional work. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nSteve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities and Operations\nAdditional contact names:\nTom Armstrong, Director, Bond Program Management, De Anza College\nDonna Jones-Dulin, Associate Vice President, Finance & Educational Resources, De Anza College\nPam Grey, Director, Purchasing Services\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
