The contract provides hosting space in an off-site location to house back-up servers and data equipment, and also provides three (3) years of high speed connectivity network service between the district data center and collocation site at Carlsbad, CA. The recurring costs include Abtech maintenance services and network connectivity charges to the CENIC network.\n\t \nCENIC is a non-profit 501(c)3 formed and managed by the educational segments which includes the University of California, the California State Universities, the California Community Colleges, the majority of the K-12 school districts, plus Stanford, Caltech and USC. CENIC’s primary mission is to provide affordable, high-speed network connections for the K-20 Research & Education community in California. Because Abtech Support is not eligible for a direct connection of CENIC’s CalREN network, CENIC cannot invoice Abtech Support directly and thus needs to contract with and invoice district directly. At the April 6, 2009 Board meeting, the Board approved CENIC as a separate vendor for this purpose.\n\t \nBased on the board approved agenda item, ETS entered an agreement with CENIC and established a contract agreement to execute the payment to CENIC. The contract has since been renewed for a 3 year term on June18, 2012 by the Board.

The District selected Ford/Gravel based on the information and specifications provided by the Disability Support Programs & Services staff.\n\t \nThe State of California awarded competitive contracts to two bus sales companies: A-Z Bus Sales and Creative Bus Sales. Purchasing requested pricing from both companies per the information and specifications provided from the department. A-Z Bus Sales quoted $87,982.85 (plus applicable sales tax and fees) and Creative Bus Sales is $88,890.00 (plus applicable sales tax and fees).\n\t \nBecause the estimate cost of the Ford/Graval Medium Duty Bus will exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $86,000, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts award by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking”. The competitively bid California Contract with A-Z Bus Sales is available and includes the items required by the college.\n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than offered on the California Contract for the same goods and services. The California Contract established discounts for Medium Duty Buses and 5 years/100,000 mile Limited Body Warranty.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nStacey Shears, John Pham\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

The contracts covered many components in addition to Banner software including license and maintenance agreements for other software applications that integrate with Banner, but are produced by different vendors. One software application was the Oracle database management system (Oracle DBMS), which is produced and licensed by the Oracle Corporation.\n\t \nIn order to safeguard the critical Oracle database infrastructure, the District is looking into the additional licensing of data encryption technology from Oracle and Ellucian. This technology is tightly integrated at the database level, and can only be licensed from the Oracle Corporation through Ellucian services. When implemented, the technology will encrypt all the data elements at rest. In case a data breach occurs, the data cannot be read without a special encryption key.\n\t \nTo encrypt the Oracle database, the District needs to license additional software from Oracle and implementation services from Ellucian. The cost to implement this project is summarized at the table below:\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \nOne time\nRecurring\nSoftware license cost\n$173,478\n\t\t\t\t\t \nImplementation\n$ 45,236\n\t\t\t\t\t \nMaintenance /Year\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$ 38,165*\n3 Years total\n$218,714\n$120,314*\nGrand Total: $339,028\n·       * The cost of the maintenance agreement increases by 5% a year but is also adjusted periodically for the size of the institution based on FTES.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJoe Moreau, Vice Chancellor of Technology\nAdditional contact names:\nChien Shih\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Because the estimated cost of the furniture may exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $86,000, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking”.  The competitively bid National Cooperative Purchasing Alliance (NCPA) contract with Demco Inc. is available and it includes the items that are required by De Anza College.  The NCPA contract was a competitive solicitation and it was awarded through Region 14 (a local government agency in the State of Texas) on behalf of itself and all states, local governments, school districts, and higher education institutions, and other government agencies. District staff, and legal counsel have reviewed and approve of using the NCPA contract. \n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the prices offered on the NCPA contract for the same goods and services. The NCPA contract awarded to Demco Inc. establishes discounts for various furniture lines and is inclusive of project management services, field measurements and design services, along with tailgate delivery \n\t \nThe furniture will be purchased using Measure C funds.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services x6166\nAdditional contact names:\nDonna Jones Dulin, Lorrie Ranck, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",
