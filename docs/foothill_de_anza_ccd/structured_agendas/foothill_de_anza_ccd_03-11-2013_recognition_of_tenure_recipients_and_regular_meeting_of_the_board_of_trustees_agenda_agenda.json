The attached executive summary of the change in the law details the rationale for adoption of the new policy.\n\t \nDistrict administrative procedures (AP) 3500 and 3501 have been revised to allow for the special events exemption in addition to the previously allowed exceptions for Foundation sponsored fundraising events (Section 25608{a}(10)) and for certain events at the Flint Center which are not sponsored by the College District and held while the Flint Center is under lease to a private, non-profit corporation (section 25608{a}(5)). The approved administrative procedures are included for clarification.\n\t \nLegal counsel vetted the new policy and revised procedures, and the Chancellor’s Advisory Council reviewed and approved both the changes to the administrative procedures and the new policy on January 25, 2013.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nKevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor of Business Services, extension 6201\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
