Changes in the relevant building codes and careful structural analysis of the facility provoked a review of alternatives, including demolition of the facility and rebuilding a ground level parking lot.  There is no cost effective alternative that would insure adequate structural integrity for the long run, so college and district staff recommend demolition of the existing structure and rebuilding a surface parking lot. Staff seek authorization to initiate plan changes with the Division of State Architect.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nSteve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities and Operations\nAdditional contact names:\nTom Armstrong, Director, Bond Program Management, De Anza College\nDonna Jones-Dulin, Associate Vice President, Finance & Educational Resources, De Anza College\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

WRNS Studio prepared the bid documents for the work.\n\t \nPursuant to Public Contract Code section 20103.8(C), the bid specifications state that the lowest responsive, responsible bid shall be determined as the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive items that when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the bid form and added to the base contract are less than or equal to the funding amount publically disclosed by the District. The District disclosed a funding amount of $100,000.  \n\t \nThe bid was legally advertised to contractors on August 8 and August 15, 2014. The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builder’s exchanges and advertised in the Daily Pacific Builder as well as posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Bids were publicly opened and read on September 18, 2014 in the Purchasing Services office. Three (3) contractors submitted bids.

Ellis & Ellis previously completed the signage and wayfinding projects at De Anza College and it has completed signage projects for San Mateo College and University of California, Berkeley. \n\t \nMeasure C will fund the project.  At this time the alternates will not be accepted; however, if the campus identifies additional funds for such work, then the bid specifications provide that the alternates can be deferred for consideration at a later date and at the same cost provided in the bid proposal.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services - x6166\nAdditional contact names:\n Steven Kitchen - x6150, Art Heinrich - x6295, Gina Bailey - x6165\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",
