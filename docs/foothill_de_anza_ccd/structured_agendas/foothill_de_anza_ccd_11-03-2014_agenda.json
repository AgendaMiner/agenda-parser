The work includes reconnecting the new boilers into the existing cogen systems and connecting the PE complex to the campus Building Management System (BMS). The project provides efficient hot water delivery to the showers with the purchase and installation of one (1) new high-efficiency condensing boiler, one (1) new circulation pump and modifications to the piping. For better equipment servicing, the project includes the relocation of the existing pulsar chlorination units, the CO2 bulk tank and associated pool chemicals and pumps to an above-grade location. \nThe Alternates include: (#1) replacing the pool and building hot water heat exchangers and associated piping/components; (#2) adding a second condensing boiler for the domestic hot water loop to provide redundancy and minimize overburdening of the equipment; and (#3) adding gauges and controls to better observe and maintain operations of the equipment.\n\t \nThe bid legally advertised to contractors on September 4 and September 11, 2014.

Because the estimated cost of the furniture may exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $84,100, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking”. The competitively bid Foundation for California Community Colleges (FCCC) contract with Steelcase is available and it includes the items that may be required by the District. The FCCC contract was awarded under a competitive solicitation following the provisions of California’s Public Contract Code. The Foundation acted in the capacity of a California Community College District and infused piggybackable language to allow for any of California’s community colleges to utilize the Agreement.\n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the prices offered on the FCCC contract for the same goods and services. The FCCC contract establish discounts for furniture inclusive of specification development services, space planning services, installation drawings, shipping and delivery costs, a 15-year parts and labor warranty, and installation services. On larger purchases, the district negotiates lower pricing than what is offered on the contract. \n\t \nIn addition, Steelcase makes a donation of one percent for all purchases to the California Community Colleges Scholarship Endowment.  All donations that result from the District’s purchases will be allocated to the District’s account and the resulting scholarships will go to the Foothill-De Anza students.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nSteve Kitchen, Roseanne Sciacchitano, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

A presentation from staff will be given to the Board of Trustees in the open meeting that will clarify the details of the Power Point presentation and answer any questions the Trustees may have.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nSteve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities and Operations, extension 6150\nAdditional contact names:\nArt Heinrich, Director, Bond Program Management, Foothill College\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Driver (CWD) as the Lease-Leaseback contractor for the Education Center (Project). The Preconstruction Services Agreement requires CWD to solicit competitive bids to develop a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for each of three Project construction phases.  On July 1, 2013 the Board of Trustees approved execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease for the Project, which included a GMP for only the Site Demolition Phase of the project.  CWD has completed that phase of work for the amount of the GMP.  \n\t \nThis Amendment modifies the Facilities Lease to include a GMP for an Early Site Work Phase of the Project in the amount of $2,634,288.  This phase includes: improvements to Innovation Way in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement with the City of Sunnyvale; sanitary sewer service; domestic water service; reclaimed water service; fire water service; natural gas service; and underground work in preparation for electric and telecommunication work to be installed by service providers.  This work falls under the jurisdiction of the City of Sunnyvale and the respective utility providers, so it does not require approval by the Division of the State Architect (DSA).  The GMP includes some work to provide utility connections for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for which the District will be reimbursed by that agency under a Memorandum of Agreement between the District and VA.\n\t \nDuring construction of this Early Site Work Phase a GMP for the following Building and Site Construction Phase will be developed by CWD.  Upon approval of building plans by DSA, a final Amendment to the Facilities Lease will be brought to the Board of Trustees that will include the GMP for that phase and the final cost for all phases. The construction budget for all Project phases is $25,200,000.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\nSteve Kitchen, x6150; Art Heinrich, x6295\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
