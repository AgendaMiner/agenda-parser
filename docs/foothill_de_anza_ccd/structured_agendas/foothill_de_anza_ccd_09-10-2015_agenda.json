Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, addresses financial reporting for state and local government pension plans. Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, establishes new accounting and financial reporting requirements for governments that provide their employees with pensions.\n\t \nThe Statements apply specifically to governments and pension plans in which a government’s contributions to the trust used to administer a pension plan are (a) irrevocable, (b) restricted to paying pension benefits, and (c) are beyond the reach of creditors.  These new Statements relate to accounting and financial reporting issues — how pension costs and obligations are measured and reported in audited external financial reports.\n\t \nThe new pension standards reflect several changes from those currently in place regarding how governments calculate their total pension liability. The measurement process detailed in the new standards involves three essential steps:\nProjecting future benefit payments for current and former employees and their beneficiaries; \nDiscounting those payments to their present value; and \nAllocating the present value over past, present, and future periods of employee service.\nGASB Statement No. 67 was effective in fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.  GASB Statement No. 68 is effective in fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6202\nAdditional contact names:\n Hector Quinonez, Executive Director, Fiscal Services, x6250\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",
