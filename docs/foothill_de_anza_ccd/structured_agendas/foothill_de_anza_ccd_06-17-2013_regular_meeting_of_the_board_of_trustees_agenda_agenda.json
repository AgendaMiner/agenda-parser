These agents send students overseas to undertake their college and university study. Over the past five years, we employed the services of this contractor, Gregory Barattini, who helped us to significantly increase the number of relationships we maintain with agents all over China, Indonesia, the rest of Southeast Asia and Europe. This expansion was a strong factor in the past few years in the District being able to increase international student enrollment despite the very challenging economic environment. In addition, the contractor helped reduce the District’s travel expenses by representing us at many international study abroad fairs and exhibitions.\n\t \nThis contract would extend the services of Gregory Barattini for a one-year period starting July 1st. Mr. Barattini is a recognized professional expert and is the only individual known to me who provides this kind of international student recruitment representation to colleges and universities. For years, he worked as the senior vice president for marketing at several large international language school chains, recently represented Santa Monica College in a similar capacity over a four-year period, and has done an excellent job for FHDA over the past five years. His clients also include Berkeley Colleges in New York City and UCLA Extension. He fully understands what the District has to offer and how to market us abroad, and is on a first-name basis with a very large number of advising agents around the world. In addition, he is physically located in Indonesia, which allows him to travel inexpensively throughout the region and saves us considerable expenses. \n\t \nThe contractor will provide year-round recruitment representation in Southeast and South Asia, in Turkey and in Scandinavia. Specifically, he will:\nDevelop relationships for FHDA with additional new educational advising agents;\nStrengthen relationships with existing agents;\nProvide representation at large study abroad fairs and agent seminars; and\nProvide ongoing recruitment and international marketing advice.\nThe contractor will provide these services to FHDA and to one or two other institutions, which will equally share in travel and related expenses.  He will not represent any other community college.\n\t \nThe contractor will be paid $3,500.00 per month and will invoice us for the District’s share of his travel expenses, which will not exceed $50,000.00 for the academic year.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGeorge Beers, ext. 7077\nAdditional contact names:\nJudy Miner, ext. 7200\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Much of the foundation's work relies heavily on parent and community contributions to fund district-wide programs. De Anza College normally charges for use of the main gym at a rate of $110 per hour for non-profit organizations. Parking is normally charged at $3 per space. We request these two fees be waived. The rental group will pay all direct costs.\n\t \nThe Cherry Blossom Festival - April\nThe Cherry Blossom Festival honoring Cupertino's sister city of Toyokawa, Japan, is an annual event held at Memorial Park each April. This event offers a wide selection of Japanese food and beverages, entertainment, demonstrations, cultural exhibits, art, crafts and clothing for sale. The festival benefits the non-profit Cupertino Sister City Committee, which promotes friendship and student exchange programs between the two cities. Local non-profit organizations that support services for disadvantaged youth, sports, music and language programs have booths to raise funds for their groups. Parking is normally charged at $3 per space. We request this fee be waived. The rental group will pay any direct costs.\n\t \nThe Kiwanis Special Games – May\nThe Kiwanis Special Games were created to address the physical and emotional needs of the substantial number of extremely challenged children in the schools of our region. Two Adaptive PE teachers and Los Altos Kiwanian, Walter Chronert, first organized the Games in 1979. Under Walt’s leadership, spanning more then 25 years, the Games flourished from modest beginnings involving just the Los Altos Kiwanis Club to the regional event they are today.  The Games are be run by about 250 Kiwanians, 300 Kiwanis student volunteers and over 1,000 school and community volunteers. The Los Altos Kiwanis Club and The De Anza Kiwanis Club of Cupertino manage the event. The athletic fields are normally charged at a rate of $90 per hour; the stadium at a rate of $131 per hour; and the track at a rate of $66 per hour for non-profit organizations. Parking is normally charged at $3 per space. We request these fees be waived.

Installation includes: new shower partitions, new ADA-approved shower seats, new ADA-approved grab bars, replacing or re-installing ceramic floor & wall tile, re-installation of shower heads & shower faucet panels, and the patch and paint of gypsum wallboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nArch-Pac, Inc. prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nBid Document #1644-200F was legally advertised on April 5, 2013 and April 12, 2013.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Eight (8) contractors attended the Mandatory Bid Walk that was held on April 18, 2013.  Bids were publicly opened and read on May 14, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. by Purchasing Services.  Only one bidder submitted a bid, R.C. Benson & Sons, Inc. General Contractors (R.C. Benson) for the base bid proposal amount of $100,000. \nSince only one bid was received, Gilbane staff contacted several contractors that attended the mandatory job walk and asked why they did not submit bids.  The common answers were: 1) the project’s scope was smaller than what they want to dedicate resources to in this economy, and 2) the project’s tight summer schedule did not fit into their overall staffing schedule, which is typically very busy during the summer.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nFurthermore, Alejandro Pinnick of Arch Pac, Inc. and Gilbane staff also conclude that the reason only one bid was submitted and it was at a higher cost than the architectural estimate was due to 1) multiple trades constructing small components of work in various rooms and 2) the overlapping integration of physically getting work purchased, prepared, and executed in the time frame the District required. \n\t\t\t\t\t \nThe bid price of $100,000 for the Base Bid Proposal Amount submitted by R.C. Benson exceeds the architect’s estimate of $80,000, however, it is within the overall Project #200F budget of $162,000.  Therefore, the Measure C bond team recommends award a contract for the base bid proposal amount to R.C. Benson.  This project is funded by Measure C.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nR.C. Benson and its listed subcontractors have each signed the “Agreement To Be Bound” and the “Agreement of Contractors” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.  Purchasing Services staff has confirmed that R.C. Benson successfully completed Project 153C, Psychology Offices Acoustical Improvement at Foothill College in 2011 and Project 116, Deck Repair and Window Replacement for the Japanese Cultural Center at Foothill College in 2013.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, Int.
