The District and ETS staff have collaborated with Cody Anderson Wasney Architects to develop a design that adapts the DOB facility to use as office space for the ETS staff.  The project team is preparing to issue revised design instructions to the General Contractor in a series of Work Packages in order to facilitate the Contractor’s flow of work and minimize delay impacts on the project. \n\t \nWork Packages to be issued by the architect, resulting in change orders to the contractor, are planned to include abatement and demolition of existing walls and structure; architectural floor plan changes; mechanical, electrical, and plumbing instructions; and architectural finishes. The construction cost of some of these change orders, and the total cost of the work, is anticipated to exceed $50,000.  \n\t \nIn order to facilitate the Contractor’s flow of work and minimize delay impacts on the project, one time approval is requested to issue change directives as follows, subject to subsequent final negotiations and board approval: \nDemolition and associated asbestos removal – Not to Exceed $75,000\nFloor plan changes – Not to Exceed $75,000\nSubmitted by:\nCharles Allen x6150\nAdditional contact names:\nJoe Moreau x6120, Art Heinrich x6295\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

All five bids submitted exceeded the overall project budget.  The board was advised that District staff would revise the scope of work and evaluate it for rebidding in the future.\n\t \nThe project was re-scoped by removing the sheet metal bird deterrents and the basis of award was modified to allow the contract to be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. The lowest bidder would be determined in accordance with Public Contract Code (PCC) 20103.8 (c) which states:\n\t \nthe lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the bid form and added to, or subtracted from, the base contract, are less than, or equal to, a funding amount publicly disclosed by the District before the first bid is opened.\n\t \nThe bid documents publicly disclosed that the construction project funding amount was $350,000 and included a list of additive and deductive items.  \n\t \nProdis Associates Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department. \n\t \nThe bid was legally advertised to contractors on January 30, 2014, and February 6, 2014.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  A mandatory bid walk was held on February 13, 2014, and a total of twelve (12) contractors attended the walk.  Bids were publicly opened and read on March 6, 2014 in the Purchasing Services office.  Five (5) contractors submitted a bid and the bid results are summarized on the attached spreadsheet:\n\t \nIn applying PCC 20103.8 (c), Purchasing Services determined that Calstate Construction, Inc. is the lowest responsive responsible bidder based upon the Base Bid and Alternates 1 through 3 at a total amount of $319,555. The bid price submitted by Calstate Construction, Inc. is within the overall project budget of $350,000.  Therefore, the Measure C Bond Team recommends that the Board award a contract for the base bid proposal amount plus Alternates 1 through 3 to Calstate Construction, Inc. This project is funded by Measure C.\n\t \nCalstate Construction, Inc. successfully completed Project 109, P.E. Lab Space Remodel and Project 420A, District Office Building Swing Space for the Foothill De Anza Community College District.   \n\t \nFurthermore, Calstate Construction, Inc. and its listed subcontractors have each signed the “Agreement To Be Bound” and the “Agreement of Contractors” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nCharles Allen, Art Heinrich, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
