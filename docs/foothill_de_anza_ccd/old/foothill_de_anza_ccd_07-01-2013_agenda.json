                    "item_details": "\nBackground and Analysis:\n\t \nUnder Pension Reform, new regulations require that all retirees must serve a 180-day wait period following retirement prior to being reemployed in a STRS/PERS eligible position. Failure to do so places the retiree’s pension earnings at risk whereby any compensation earned during the first 180 days will reduce pension earnings and/or require reinstatement from retirement. The regulations also provide however that an exception may be granted under the condition that the Governing Board approves such resolution in an Open Meeting as a separate item not on a consent agenda, that certifies the nature of the employment and that the appointment is necessary to fill a critically needed position before 180 days have passed.\n\t \nRequest for Exception:\nDe Anza College is requesting exception to the 180-day wait period for Susan Bloom, Financial Aid Coordinator, to work as a temporary employee starting 7/2/13 immediately following her retirement on June 30, 2013, due to the need to fill this critical position prior to the expiration of the 180-day waiting period. Expected duration of the appointment is July 2, 2013 through September 30, 2013.\n\t \nBackground Regarding This Unfilled Position:\nThe college completed and submitted the position documentation and recruitment requisition shortly after Ms. Bloom’s February letter of retirement was submitted. They began recruiting for the coordinator position in March, following Board approval of Ms. Bloom’s retirement. The search process began in March, including forming the committee, posting the position, and proceeding with collection and review of applications and interview of selected applicants. However, based on an assessment and determination (June 10) of candidates, no one was selected to fill the Financial Aid Coordinator position. \n\t \nJustification:\nThe College was unable to fill her position before her retirement at the end of this month, but her work in disbursing student financial aid and handling related key functions (see attached) have to be performed without interruption. This position cannot be performed by other existing staff in the office or another temporary employee due to the highly technical and specialized nature of most of the responsibilities assigned this position, which also requires authorization and access to various Department of Education sites and systems. Considering the new Director of Financial Aid will not begin working until after July 1, the College needs a Financial Aid Coordinator now with the experience, access and authorization to do the work and to provide critical transition for the new Director of Financial Aid. \n\t \nThis position is critical to maintain compliance with federal rules and regulations. The College must avoid another federal audit finding with the Return to Title IV aid. The District could receive a financial penalty if found to be out of compliance again.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nDorene Novotny, Vice Chancellor of Human Resources & Equal Opportunity \nAdditional contact names:\nSuzanne Pfeiffer, Director of Human Resources x6109\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

In accordance with the California Public Contract Code (PCC) Section 20651(a) through (d), only the governing board may authorize award of such purchase orders, and the board must award the orders to the lowest responsible bidder or reject all bids. However, in lieu of conducting a bid process, Public Contract Code (PCC) section 20652 provides that community college districts may utilize contracts that have been awarded by other public entities. \n\t \nThe required Apple and Dell products are available to the District on two Western States Contracting Alliance (WSCA) contracts.  WSCA is a contracting consortium for state government departments, institutions, agencies and political subdivisions in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.  The WSCA Master Price Agreement B27158 with Apple is currently valid through August 31, 2014. The WSCA Master Price Agreement B27160 with Dell is also currently valid through August 31, 2014.  Contracts and links to vendor pricing are posted at: http://www.mmd.admin.state.mn.us/wsca/2009-2014_contracts.asp.\n\t \nWSCA contract pricing is based upon the combined volume of several states and their political subdivisions. Each WSCA contract’s “Products and Services Schedule” (PSS) shows the maximum price offered to participating entities and provides that each entity may negotiate large order discounts. Additionally, the District is entitled to each vendor’s education discounts and may also benefit whenever the vendors announce promotional prices and/or general price reductions.  Given that the District is standardized on Apple and Dell equipment and product lines, if it were to conduct a separate bid rather than using the WSCA contracts, the sole qualified bidders would be Apple and Dell. A bid based only upon the District’s anticipated purchases would be unlikely to result in lower prices than those available through the WSCA contract. Prior to issuing each purchase order, District staff will contact the vendor to obtain a price quotation. The price quoted will be the lowest available to the District on that date for the specified products and quantities.\n\t \nETS estimates that some of the purchase order quantities for student classroom labs could exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $83,400. They are:\n\t \nFoothill Campus Labs:  Biology Department – 102 District standard Dell and Apple Desktops, and several other labs and departments – 124 District standard Apple Desktops, 43 District standard Apple Laptops, 156 District standard Dell Desktops and 8 District standard Dell Laptops. \nDe Anza Campus Labs: Advance Technology Center (ATC) – 169 District standard Apple Desktops and 361 District standard Dell Desktops, and several other labs – 104 District standard Apple Desktops, 89 District standard Dell Desktops, and 44 District standard Dell Laptops. \n\t \nThe computers will be paid for from Measure C funding for the refresh of technology equipment. The aggregate estimated cost for the student classroom labs in FY 13-14 is $1,328,000 plus applicable sales tax.  The classroom lab equipment may be replaced in kind, or it may be replaced with new or different, less expensive Apple and Dell technologies to meet each program need. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Gina Bailey, Int.

Driver (CWD) as the Lease-Leaseback contractor for the Educational Center (Project). The Board also approved the Site Lease, Facilities Lease and Construction Provisions as to form and content.  The Preconstruction Services Agreement requires CWD to develop a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for site demolition and for following Project construction phases.\n\t \nUnder the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease, the District will lease District-owned land to CWD, and CWD will agree to prepare the Project site and to construct the Project pursuant to the GMP, the District’s Construction Provisions, and CWD’s responses to RFQ/RFP 1469-801.  The District will receive incremental title to the constructed property in accordance with payments made.  The District will pay for and take title to all improvements no later than completion of construction of the Project, at which time the leases will be terminated.\n\t \nBecause it is advantageous to remove existing buildings as soon as possible, CWD solicited competitive bids to develop a $3,744,150 GMP for the Demolition Phase only. The Demolition Phase GMP is subject to adjustments for extra work and changes as directed and agreed to by the District. The GMP includes demolition of some buildings and improvements located on adjacent parcels owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the City of Sunnyvale (City).  The District will be reimbursed for the costs of that work under a Memorandum of Agreement between the District and the City and a similar Memorandum of Agreement between the District and VA.  The Board of Trustees previously approved both Memoranda.\n\t \nTwo following phases of work to complete the project are planned: an Early Site Work Phase and a Building and Site Construction Phase.  Amendments to the Facilities Lease will be made to address the GMP for those phases. The construction budget for all project phases is $25,000,000. Upon execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease, CWD will be given control of the site to commence work. Demolition is expected to be complete by March 2014.  Project occupancy is scheduled for January 2016.\n\t \nThis action item is to award the Site Lease and Facilities Lease agreements to CWD and to authorize CWD to proceed with demolition activities to construct the project (the Demolition Phase). District staff will later seek approval of modifications to the Facilities Lease agreement that will authorize an Early Site Work Phase and a Building and Site Construction Phase for construction of the project based upon DSA-approved construction documents for an amount not to exceed the GMP for each phase. Demolition does not require the Division of State Architects (DSA) review.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nGina Bailey, x6165\nAdditional contact names:\nCharles Allen, x6150; Art Heinrich, x6295\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
