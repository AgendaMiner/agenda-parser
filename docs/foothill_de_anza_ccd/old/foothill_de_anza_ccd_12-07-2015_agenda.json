Both colleges are running on an outdated version of Resource 25 software on aging hardware.  The system needs to be upgraded to ensure proper system performance and functionality. \n\t \nRecently, CollegeNet made significant investments to move the Resource 25 application from an on-premise solution to a hosted solution (\"cloud\" solution). This change eliminates many processes both colleges and ETS need to do in our local data center. We will no longer provide the hardware or maintenance to run the system. The application will be running from a site hosted by CollegeNet.\n\t \nConsequently, both colleges asked ETS to upgrade the current system to the new hosted solution. This will require the District to sign a new contract with CollegeNet. This solution guarantees the District will always have up-to-date scheduling software and hardware and a powerful and robust scheduling system to meet the needs of the scheduling and facilities offices and other Foothill-De Anza staff, faculty, and students.\n\t \nThe breakdown of one-time and recurring cost of the new contract is:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nOne time cost\nRecurring hosting cost per year\nTotal 3-year cost\nProfessional service and training*\n$26,000*\n 0.00\n$26,000\nOne time license fee\n$26,000\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$26,000\nRecurring cost\n\t\t\t\t\t \n$25,000\n$75,000\nTotal 3-year cost\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n$127,000* \n *includes two one-week on-site consultation visits.

This increase would be effective beginning 2016 summer quarter. Membership fees were last increased from $6 to $9 during the academic year 2011-2012. This proposed increase is needed to cover inflationary costs for many of the traditionally funded DASB/college programs, in addition to funding new programs since 2012.

Additional labs will assist with increased training space for five more CNC machines (15 total); increased inspection area adding one more CMM (3 total); and 30 computer seats (122 total). The labs will be used for CAD/CAM programming and simulation courses.  The proposed expansion project is estimated to be $800,000; additional tooling and fixtures for machines and inspection area estimated to be $150,000.\n\t \nDe Anza Design and Manufacturing Technologies:  The Design and Manufacturing Technologies department contains some of the nation’s leading programs.  It is NIMS accredited in machining, and it offers approximately 35 courses in CAD, CAM, CNC mill and lathe properties of materials and blueprint interpretation, among others.  The courses are offered in accelerated six week (four days per week), evening twelve week (two nights per week), Saturday and on-line classes.\n\t \nWith an annual enrollment of more than 1,500 students, the department offers four certificates and three A.S. degrees.   The department has a robust advisory council, including participation from NASA, Apple, Google, Intuitive Surgical, Northrup Grumman and Tesla Motors.\n\t \nIn 2015, De Anza offered summer teacher training courses, filling its classes to capacity with high school and community college instructors from throughout the state.  The program, with help from the Gene Haas Foundation, will continue to expand its offerings.  The department also trains apprentices for the California Machinist & Tooling Apprenticeship Association and Machinist Joint Apprenticeship Committee.  Moreover, the department has longstanding relationships with equipment manufacturers and industry, including a deep relationship with Haas Automation, Inc., as well as with the Gene Haas Foundation.\n\t \nFHDA Policy on the Naming of Facilities:  Board policy and administrative procedure 3216 provide criteria for naming that involves a gift, as in this case.  Those include:\n\t \n·      The significance of the proposed gift as it relates to the project;\n·      The urgency of need for the project or for support funds for the project;\n·      The eminence, reputation and integrity of the individual or entity whose name is proposed; and\n·      The relationship of the individual or entity to the colleges or District.\n\t \nIn addition, the district’s procedures require that the gift constitute a significant portion of the total cost of the project to be named.\n\t \nWith regard to the criteria, a $1 million gift from the foundation would construct the entire project (as outlined above).  Although the need/construction of the project is not urgent, the opportunity to secure this possible gift is urgent as the foundation is interested in granting such a gift to a community college by the end of the calendar year due in large part to the incredibly strong relationship that De Anza College and its staff have with the foundation (and with Haas Automation, Inc.). \n\t \nAlso related to the district’s criteria, it should be noted that in 2007, Mr. Gene Haas was convicted of federal tax evasion and was required to serve two years in federal prison and pay $75 million in restitution to the federal government.  His jail time was completed and the required restitution was paid, as ordered, and the conviction was not tied to the Gene Haas Foundation or its grantees.  The foundation continues to be a leader in philanthropy around the nation in the areas of advanced manufacturing, teacher training and food security.\n\t \nHistory of the Gene Haas Foundation:  The Gene Haas Foundation, in Oxnard, California, was founded in 1998 by Gene Francis Haas, founder, president and sole stockholder of Haas Automation, Inc., one of the world's leading CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) machine tool manufacturers.  The foundation gives primarily to children's charities and organizations that feed the poor, especially within the local community of Ventura County.  It also gives to scholarship funds to high schools, community colleges and special educational programs that help build skills within the machining industry.\n\t \nIn September, the Gene Haas Foundation announced a $1 million capital gift to New York’s Hudson Valley Community College as part of the college’s $12 million technology center expansion.  And, on November 4, 2015, the National Institute of Metalworking Skills (NIMS) officially opened the Gene Haas Education Center, located on its campus in Fairfax, Virginia.  This new education center was created to help educators and businesses deliver the highest quality and most relevant manufacturing training for students and employees.  (De Anza College is only one of a few colleges in California that are NIMS accredited.)\n\t \nTo date, more than 1,200 charitable organizations and schools have received more than $27 million from the Gene Haas Foundation.\n\t \n·      Foundation assets as of December 2013:  $94.5 million\n·      Total giving in 2013:  $3.1 million\n·      Website:  http://ghaasfoundation.org/\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nDe Anza College President Brian Murphy\nAdditional contact names:\nFoothill-De Anza Foundation Director of Development Dennis Cima\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

This action requests authority to draft changes to the 401(a) Plan (the “Plan”), file an IRS determination letter application for the amended Plan, and delegation of authority to adopt technical changes to the Plan required to obtain a favorable IRS determination letter. \n\t \nThe Board of Trustees is being asked to consider and approve a Resolution to adopt an amendment to the Plan to limit participation to qualified former members of the Board of Trustees following a finding by an Administrative Law Judge and confirmation by the CalPERS Board of Administration that participation in the Plan by retired employees under the status of 20-Year Retiree would not qualify such retirees for coverage under the CalPERS retiree health program.  In addition, in accordance with CalPERS requirements, the Plan will be submitted to the IRS for a determination on its tax-qualified status prior to January 31, 2016. The Board of Trustees also is requested to delegate authority to make any technical changes to the Plan required to obtain the favorable determination from the IRS.  \n\t \n1.         Amendment to 401(a) Plan\n\t \nA.        Background\n\t \nIn 2012, the District contracted with CalPERS to provide health coverage for current and former employees who are eligible for District-provided health benefits under the Public Employees Medical and Hospital Care Act (\"PEMHCA\").  At that time, there was a concern that certain former employees who qualify for lifetime retiree health benefits under one of the District's collective bargaining agreements would not meet the PEMHCA eligibility rules for retiree coverage, because they were not receiving a monthly retirement allowance, i.e., an annuity.  The Board adopted the Plan to address this concern.  The Plan is a supplemental retirement plan that provides a monthly retirement allowance to former employees who are not yet retired under CalPERS or CalSTRS, and to former members of the Board of Trustees, who qualify for District-provided lifetime retiree health benefits.\n\t \nCalPERS officials denied PEMHCA eligibility for former District retirees who were covered under the Plan, but were not retired under CalPERS or CalSTRS.  However, CalPERS officials decided that former members of the Board of Trustees are eligible for PEMHCA coverage on the basis of receiving a retirement allowance from the Plan.\n\t \nThe District's appeal of the CalPERS decision with respect to former employees was heard in March of this year by an Administrative Law Judge, who denied the appeal in a proposed decision that was adopted as final by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its meeting on November 18, 2015.  This means that the Plan will not serve the purpose of enabling certain former employees to meet the PEMHCA eligibility requirements for retiree coverage, so participation for these former employees should be terminated.\n\t \nB.        Plan Amendment\n\t \nAccordingly, we propose that the Plan be amended to cover only qualified former members of the Board of Trustees, effective January 1, 2016.  A Board Resolution and Plan Amendment for this purpose are attached.\n\t \n2.         IRS Determination Letter Application\n\t \nThe Plan is intended to qualify for tax-favored status under section 401 and related sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition, CalPERS rules require that this type of retirement plan obtain a favorable IRS determination letter.  The District will apply to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on the Plan's tax-qualified status before January 31, 2016, the current deadline for IRS filings for governmental plans such as the Plan. We also are proposing that the Board of Trustees delegate authority to adopt any technical amendments that may be required in order to obtain a favorable determination letter from the IRS.  \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nKevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

The Preconstruction Services Agreement required Swinerton Builders to prequalify subcontractors, obtain competitive bids from subcontractors, develop an actual Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and develop a Preliminary Construction Schedule. On April 6, 2015 the Board of Trustees approved the execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease for Phase 1 of the L-7 renovation project, which included a GMP for Phase 1, in the amount of $2,734,249. \n\t \nThe scope of work for Phase 1 included renovating the L-7 exterior facade; renovating the classrooms interiors; upgrading power and HVAC to the building; re-roofing, new interior and exterior painting; fire alarm upgrades; lighting upgrades; accessibility upgrades, and miscellaneous interior upgrades as shown on the contract documents. Phase 1 of the L-7 Renovation project was funded by Measure C and is substantially complete. \n\t \nFor Phase 2, Swinerton Builders prequalified subcontractors, obtained competitive bids from subcontractors, developed a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and provided its construction schedule. The GMP for Phase 2 was established based upon the DSA-submitted set of drawings and specifications. Phase 2 of the L-7 project will include: replacing the fire suppression system and connect it into the fire alarm systems; removes under-floor data and electrical cabling and replaces the raised floor system; installs new UPS systems; installs new overhead electrical and data raceways, data and power distribution, and added grounding; installs new lighting; installs new data equipment cabinets; installs limited data and fiber connections; and provides new interior finishes. \n\t \nSwinerton Builders’ GMP for Phase 2 of this project is $1,773,585 and will be funded by Measure C. Upon execution of the Amendment No. 1 of the Facilities Lease, Swinerton Builders will continue with its control of the site to commence with Phase 2 work.
