These agents send students overseas to undertake their college and university study. Over the past six years, we employed the services of this contractor, Gregory Barattini, who helped us to significantly increase the number of relationships we maintain with agents all over China, Indonesia, the rest of Southeast Asia and Europe. This expansion was a strong factor in the past few years in the District being able to increase international student enrollment despite the very challenging economic environment. In addition, the contractor helped reduce the District’s travel expenses by representing us at many international study abroad fairs and exhibitions.\n\t \nThis contract would extend the services of Gregory Barattini for a one-year period starting July 7, 2014. Mr. Barattini is a recognized professional expert and is the only individual known to me who provides this kind of international student recruitment representation to colleges and universities. For years, he worked as the senior vice president for marketing at several large international language school chains, recently represented Santa Monica College in a similar capacity over a four-year period, and has done an excellent job for FHDA over the past six years. His clients also include Berkeley Colleges in New York City and UCLA Extension. He fully understands what the District has to offer and how to market us abroad, and is on a first-name basis with a very large number of advising agents around the world. In addition, he is physically located in Indonesia, which allows him to travel inexpensively throughout the region and saves us considerable expenses. \n\t \nThe contractor will provide year-round recruitment representation in Southeast and South Asia, in Turkey and in Scandinavia. Specifically, he will:\nDevelop relationships for FHDA with additional new educational advising agents;\nStrengthen relationships with existing agents;\nProvide representation at large study abroad fairs and agent seminars; and\nProvide ongoing recruitment and international marketing advice.\nThe contractor will provide these services to FHDA and to one or two other institutions, which will equally share in travel and related expenses.  He will not represent any other community college.\n\t \nThe contractor will be paid $3,800.00 per month and will invoice us for the District’s share of his travel expenses, which will not exceed $50,000.00 for the academic year.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJudy C.

The resolution supports modification of the method by which commercial properties are assessed in order to increase funding for public schools. According to Evolve's web site, four community college districts have adopted the attached resolution supporting the effort as have a number of K-12 school districts and city councils.\n\t \nProposition 13 limits the property tax rate to one percent of the assessed value of a home at the time of purchase and holds annual tax increases to no more than two percent until the property is sold. Under Proposition 13, industrial, commercial, and residential property are treated the same. When Proposition 13 passed in 1978, 40 percent of property taxes in California were paid by commercial property owners, but that percentage has been reduced to 28 percent over time, in part due to commercial property transactions in which ownership is transferred in sequential transactions among several parties to avoid triggering reassessment. Evolve estimates that an additional $6 billion per year would be available to fund public schools and services if the proposal to reassess commercial properties more often were enacted.\n\t \nThe resolution leaves open whether the effort would be through the initiative process or via a constitutional amendment placed on the ballot by the Legislature. It is too late to begin an initiative campaign for placement on the November 2014 general election ballot, so any effort requiring signature gathering would be for 2016. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\nLinda Thor\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

a portion of the 2006 Series B Bonds was previously refunded through the issuance of the District’s 2012 General Obligation Refunding Bonds.\n\t \nThe attached analysis from Morgan Stanley indicates there is currently an opportunity for debt service savings by refinancing portions of the outstanding 1999 Series C Bonds, 2006 Series A Bonds and 2006 Series B Bonds.  The refunding opportunity is dependent on market conditions and will be evaluated for potential savings to the taxpayers at the time of the sale.  The district refinancing team composed of Business Office personnel, our underwriter, bond counsel, and our independent financial advisor will make a brief presentation explaining the terms of the agreement at the Board of Trustees meeting.\n\t \nBond Resolution.  Resolution No. 2014-20 before the Board authorizes the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds (the “Bonds”) to accomplish the refinancing.  The resolution specifies the basic terms, parameters and forms of the Refunding Bonds, and approves the forms of a Purchase Contract, Escrow Agreement and Preliminary Official Statement described below.  The Refunding Bonds are only authorized to be issued as current interest bonds.  Capital appreciation bonds are not authorized.  In particular, Section 1 of the Resolution establishes the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds issued ($125,000,000).  Section 4 of the Resolution states the maximum underwriting discount (1.0%) with respect to the Refunding Bonds, and authorizes the Refunding Bonds to be sold at a negotiated sale to Morgan Stanley.  All the benefits of refunding must be given to the local taxpayers; the District will not receive any money from the transaction.  \n\t \nForm of Purchase Contract.  Pursuant to the Purchase Contract, Morgan Stanley will agree to buy the Refunding Bonds from the District.  All the conditions of closing the transaction are set forth in this document, including the documentation to be provided at the closing by various parties.  Upon the pricing of the Refunding Bonds, the final execution copy of the Purchase Contract will be prepared following this form.\n\t \nForm of Preliminary Official Statement.  The Preliminary Official Statement (“POS”) is the offering document describing the Refunding Bonds, which may be distributed to prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds.  The POS discloses information with respect to among other things (i) the proposed uses of proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, (ii) the terms of the Refunding Bonds (interest rate, redemption terms, etc.), (iii) the bond insurance policy for the Refunding Bonds, if any, (iv) the security for repayment of the Refunding Bonds (the ad valorem tax levy), (v) information with respect to the District’s tax base (upon which such ad valorem taxes may be levied), (vi) District financial and operating data, (vii) continuing disclosure with respect to the Refunding Bonds and the District, and (viii) absence of litigation and other miscellaneous matters expected to be of interest to prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds.  Following the pricing of the Refunding Bonds, a final Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds will be prepared, substantially in the form of the POS.\n\t \nEscrow Agreement.  Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds in an amount sufficient to accomplish the refunding will be deposited in an escrow fund (the “Escrow Fund”) held by U.S. Bank National Association (acting as “Escrow Agent”).  The monies in the Escrow Fund will be used by the Escrow Agent to pay each of the refunded 1999 Series C Bonds, 2006 Series A Bonds and 2006 Series B Bonds on the first available optional redemption dates therefor.  As a result of the deposit and application of funds so provided in the Escrow Agreement, the prior bonds will be completely paid off and the obligation of Santa Clara County to levy ad valorem taxes for payment of the Prior Bonds will cease.\n\t \nDistrict administration is recommending approval of the resolution, which authorizes the District to exercise the refunding options if market conditions are favorable. The sale for the refunding of these bonds is currently scheduled for July 15, with a closing on August 19.\n\t \nRelated documents included in this packet are: Morgan Stanley’s analysis of projected savings and Financing Timetable.\n\t \nSee attached Executive Summary for more details.\n\t \nVice Chancellor of Business Services, Kevin McElroy recommends that the Board:\n\t \n1.      Approve Resolution No. 2014-20 authorizing Issuance of 2014 General Obligation Refunding Bonds   \n         (1999 Series C for Measure E and 2006 Series A and B for Measure C) (This resolution includes a  \n         Form of Current Interest Bond);\n\t \n2.      Approve the form of the Preliminary Official Statement\n\t \n3.      Approve the form of the Purchase Contract and;\n\t \n4.      Approve the form of the Escrow Agreement.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6202\nAdditional contact names:\n Hector Quinonez, Executive Director, Fiscal Services, x6250,\n Joni Hayes, Director, Budget Operations, x6261\nIs backup provided?\n Yes (Presentation posted 7/7/14)\n\t \n",

This work is required as part of a City of Los Altos special encroachment permit that was obtained to allow construction of the bridge at Parking Lot 1, a part of which is located within the City of Los Altos sewer line easement\n\t \nSandis Engineers prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department. \n\t \nBid #1689-135 was legally advertised to contractors April 29, 2014, and May 6, 2014.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  A non-mandatory bid walk was held on May 13, 2014, and a total of two (2) contractors attended the walk.  Bids were publicly opened and read on June 5, 2014 in the Purchasing Services office.  Three (3) contractors submitted a bid and the bid results are summarized below:\n\t \nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\nTOTAL BASE BID PROPOSAL AMOUNT\nNor-Cal Pipeline Services\n$32,500\nDexal Construction Inc. \n$33,200\nRodan Builders, Inc. \n$68,500\n\t \nA notice of Intent to Award was sent to all bidders on June 17, 2014 and on June 21, 2014, Purchasing Services staff received a bid protest letter from the second apparent low bidder, Dexal Construction Inc. (Dexal).  The letter alleges that Nor-Cal Pipeline Services is not the lowest responsible bidder, since it had not included a signed Project Stabilization Agreement (PSA) in its bid and that Dexal “fulfilled correctly” the required submittals, therefore Dexal is the lowest responsible bidder. Purchasing Services consulted with District's legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret, regarding the bid protest. It is Mr. Jaret's opinion that the failure of Nor-Cal Pipeline Services to include the requisite signed PSA documents with its bid, but a later curing of that shortly thereafter by Nor-Cal Pipeline Services with the executed documents, is a minor irregularity that can and should be waived by the District. \n\t \nNor-Cal Pipeline Services has successfully completed projects for East Palo Alto Sanitary District, City of Ione and City of Santa Cruz and signed the Appendix A, “Agreement To Be Bound,” and Appendix C, Construction Careers Program Agreement of Contractors, of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building and Construction Trades Council. \n\t \nThe bid price of $32,500 submitted by Nor-Cal Pipeline Services is within the construction estimate of $60,000 and it is within the overall project budget of $80,000.  This project is funded by Measure C.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\nArt Heinrich, Annette Perez\nIs backup provided?\nNo\n\t \n",

Adjustments in prices may commence beginning the third year not to exceed 3 % per year. It is anticipated that over the course of five years that the aggregate cost of the annual maintenance would be approximately $160,000.  Minor repairs and repainting required throughout each year on an as needed basis will be by separate contract. The annual maintenance of the gymnasium floors will be paid for from Measure C Scheduled Maintenance funds.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Roseanne Sciacchitano, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n",
