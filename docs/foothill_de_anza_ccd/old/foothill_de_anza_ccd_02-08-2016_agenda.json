                    "item_details": "\nBackground and Analysis:\n\t \nIn January 2015, Foothill College began the process of updating the Educational Master Plan (EMP). The current plan (2010-2020) was completed in 2009-2010 to serve as the primary planning document for the college, demonstrating how the institution’s activities and initiatives support the college mission statement. While this plan has been revised since the fall 2011 accreditation site visit, participatory governance discussions indicated that there was support to conduct a full update of the EMP in preparation for the upcoming accreditation self-study (2016-17) and site visit (Fall 2017). An update, rather than a revision of the document, was also deemed appropriate due to the significant changes that occurred with the college’s governance, planning and budget prioritization processes since the last site visit. As part of the continuous cycle of improvement, the college seeks to ensure that this EMP update reflects how the institution is accomplishing its mission; whether the mission directs institutional priorities in meeting the educational needs of students; whether evidence supports these discussions; and how efforts to change, make improvements and instill accountability occur through a data-driven process.\n\t \nTo frame this EMP update effort, Foothill College is guided by its core values of honesty, integrity, trust, openness, transparency, forgiveness, and sustainability. These beliefs manifest in the process the college undertook to complete the updated document. As such, a grassroots effort was employed to determine what the institution should focus on over the next eight years. A mixed methodological approach was used to collect, review, disseminate and discuss data that would inform the EMP. Internal and external constituents were encouraged to participate, either by providing their perspective or reflecting on existing student data. Multiple modalities ensured many opportunities for inclusion and participation (face-to-face, online). While this effort required significant time and coordination, the EMP goals and objectives were identified and approved through participatory governance in less than one year (Planning and Resource Council, November 4, 2015). \n\t \nDuring this update process, the EMP steering committee recommended that the college mission be revised to be in better alignment with the EMP goals and objectives. This effort was approved in fall 2015 by the college’s main shared governance body, and this process was finalized and concluded by early December 2015 (Planning and Resource Council, December 2, 2015).\n\t \nFoothill College Educational Master Plan Goals and Objectives \n\t \nThese goals are approached in a way that exemplifies Foothill College’s culture of innovation and problem solving, with emphasis on eliminating disproportionate impact among student groups:\n\t \nCreate a culture of equity that promotes student success, particularly for underserved students.\nImplement activities to improve achievement of student outcomes among those population groups experiencing disproportionate impact.\nReduce barriers and facilitate students’ ease of access across the District and region.\nEnhance support for online quality and growth for (internet/web-based) instruction and student services.\nCollaborate with K-12, adult education and four-year institutions in ways that serve students and society.\nPartner with business and industry to prepare students for the workforce.\nStrengthen a sense of community and commitment to the College’s mission; expand participation from all constituencies in shared governance.\nEncourage student participation in leadership and activities outside the classroom (including service/work-based learning) that engages students with the College and the community.\nProvide effective onboarding, support and professional development for all college employees.\nEncourage employee participation in leadership and activities that engages them with the College and the community.\nPromote consistent and clear communication in order to create a more informed, cohesive and engaged community.\nIncrease lifelong learning opportunities for our community.\nPromote decision-making that respects the diverse needs of the entire college community.\nRecognize and support a campus culture that values ongoing improvement and stewardship of resources.\nIncrease advocacy at the state level, increase grants and private donations to secure stable and sustainable funding, and manage college resources strategically.\nExpand college practices and initiatives to support environmental stewardship.\nEmploy data-driven decision-making.\nSubmitted by:\nKimberlee Messina, Foothill College Interim President\nAdditional contact names:\nKurt Hueg, Andrew LaManque\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

During the course of construction, it was discovered that the existing roof pad was not designed to structurally uphold the replacement chiller.  Therefore, District staff worked with Salas O’Brien to develop bid specifications and receive Division of State Architect (DSA) approval of the required repairs to accommodate a new 242-ton chiller.  Additionally, Additive Alternate #1 requires the contractor to complete the installation of the Owner-furnished chiller, pumps, etc. (the scope of work which was removed from Bid #1698 in Change Order #7). \n\t \nThis bid was legally advertised to contractors on December 15 and December 22, 2015 in the San Jose Post Record/Daily Journal. Several Builders Exchanges and Contractors also received notification that they could receive bid documents through the FHDA portal of the PlanetBids website which is available by selecting \"Bid Opportunities\" at purchasing.fhda.edu.  Bids were publicly opened and read on January 22, 2016 in the Purchasing Services office. Four (4) contractors submitted bids.

Calstate has successfully performed several projects for the District and is currently working on the electronic lock project at De Anza College.\n\t \nThe construction estimate for the repairs plus the alternate work is $650,000.  The bid price of $480,944 is well within the estimated value and will be paid for by a combination of State of California Physical Plant Block Grant (Scheduled Maintenance) and Proposition 39 funds. \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n\t\t\t\t\t  Director of Purchasing Services, Pam Grey \nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t  Jennifer Mahato, Tom Armstrong, Steve Kitchen, Gina Bailey \nIs backup provided?\n\t\t\t\t\t  No\n\t \n",

Because the cost of the lighting fixtures will exceed the current statutory bid threshold of $87,800, the District must either conduct its own bidding and award process or obtain board authorization to utilize existing contracts awarded by other public entities. This process is commonly known as “piggybacking” and is permissible to utilize for community colleges under Public Contract Code section 20652. \n\t \nIn 2015 the Foundation for California Community Colleges (FCCC) competitively bid Exterior LED Luminaries (RFP #15-001). The contract was awarded to two vendors, GonLED and Wesco Distribution, Inc.  The Foundation acted in the capacity of a California Community College District and infused language to allow for any of California’s community colleges to utilize the Agreement. FCCC Contract #CB15-012 with Wesco Distribution, Inc. is valid through June 4, 2016 (with an option to renew for one additional year) and is available to the District; it includes the luminary and lighting fixtures that are required by the District. \n\t \nIt is highly unlikely that a separate bid process conducted by our District would result in more favorable prices, terms, and conditions than the prices offered on the FCCC contract for the same goods and services. The FCCC contract established discounts for luminaries and lighting fixtures, inclusive of enhanced warranties up to a 10-year period, related services, training, shipping, and delivery based on a tiered quantity system. \n\t \nAn initial purchase is estimated at about $205,000 for De Anza College quoted at the best pricing available and at the highest discount tier. The purchase will be funded by remaining Measure E dollars and also from the De Anza College facilities and equipment capital outlay funds account.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, DIrector of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Susan Cheu, Donna Jones Dulin, Tom Armstrong, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n  No\n\t \n",

The laws require that Community College Districts (1) use a standardized questionnaire for the pre-qualification process, (2) adopt a uniform system of rating bidders on objective criteria to determine qualification, and (3) create an appeal system by which a contractor that has been found to be unqualified will receive a due process hearing if it chooses to dispute the District’s finding. \n\t \nMembers of the District’s construction management team have concluded that direct contractors on certain public projects should be pre-qualified to (a) ensure the financial stability of the contractors, and to (b) promote safety, quality, timeliness, and cost effectiveness in the construction of the projects. The construction management team has determined that the contractor prequalification process will be of value for the New District Offices project and also the Flint Garage project.  It may also be applied on other projects in the future.\n\t \nA draft of the model pre-qualification documents are attached; the content can also be incorporated into a public works bid. The previous documents have been revised to incorporate a contractor interview component and modify the weighted criteria of the evaluations to place more emphasis on contractor experience. Before concluding each pre-qualification process, the Purchasing Department will report the results to the Board of Trustees. At that time, the Board can choose to either:\n\t \n          1.     Accept the list of Direct Contractors who met all of the pre-qualification requirements as the only contractors who are “pre-qualified” to bid on the project, OR \n          2.     Cancel the pre-qualification procedure for Direct Contractors for that particular project(s).\n\t \nFor each project, the pre-qualification of contractors shall be valid for one year if accepted by the Board of Trustees.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services\nAdditional contact names:\n  Steve Kitchen, Tom Armstrong, Art Heinrich, Roseanne Sciacchitano, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n  Yes\n\t \n",
