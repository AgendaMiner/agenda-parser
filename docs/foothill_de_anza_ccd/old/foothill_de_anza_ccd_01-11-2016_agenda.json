The project will be reviewed by DSA for access compliance only, a requirement of the Government Code.  \n\t \nExempting the project design from the Field Act will result in cost and time savings to the project.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nSteve Kitchen, Executive Director, Facilities and Operations\nAdditional contact names:\nKevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor x6201; Art Heinrich, Director x6295\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n\t \n",
