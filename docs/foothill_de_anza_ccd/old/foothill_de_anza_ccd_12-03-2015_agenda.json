In the case of our District, this covers the accounting and financial reporting of our representative share of the CalPERS and CalSTRS pension obligation.\n\t \nUnder GASB Statement No. 67 – Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, CalPERS and CalSTRS were required to undertake an actuarial study and an audit of their respective pension plans.  Based on the CalPERS and CalSTRS actuarial studies and audit reports, the District is required to recognize its proportionate share of the collective pension expense, report deferred outflows of resources, and deferred inflows of resources related to each of the pension plans.\n\t \nMost recently, as of one week ago, CalPERS revised their audited numbers.  CalSTRS had also undergone a restatement of their numbers some time earlier.  With the delay in obtaining accurate audited information from CalPERS and CalSTRS, the District audit report has subsequently been delayed as well. \n\t \nVavrinek, Trine, Day, & Company, LLP, Certified Public Accountants, located in Pleasanton, California, is working to complete the Foothill-De Anza Community College District annual audit for the year ended June 30, 2015 in time to present it to the Board of Trustees for acceptance at their regularly scheduled Board meeting of January 11, 2016.\n\t \nWe will bring a copy of the audit report to the Audit and Finance Committee at their regularly scheduled meeting of March 10, 2016.\n\t \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6201\nAdditional contact names:\n Hector Quinonez, Executive Director, Fiscal Services, x6250\nIs backup provided?\n No\n\t \n",
