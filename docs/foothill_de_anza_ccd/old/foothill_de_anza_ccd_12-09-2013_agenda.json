The primary motivation of philosophy is the desire for knowledge and understanding. Philosophy is an attempt to understand the nature of our reality, our attempts at knowledge, our quest for good and meaningful lives and most ambitiously, our construction of a society that might make these lives possible. Logic and critical thinking courses will explore the methodology of philosophic discourse and academic discourse in general. The student will explore the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical and political dimensions of philosophy, the history of philosophy from its beginnings in the ancient world through contemporary philosophy, and the philosophic concerns manifested in the world's religions. \n\t \nStudents who complete the Associate in Arts in Philosophy for Transfer Degree will be ensured preferential transfer status to local CSUs for Philosophy majors and/or majors in related disciplines.  The Associate in Arts in Philosophy for Transfer Degree will fulfill the lower division major requirements at many local CSUs. Students are advised, however, to meet with a counselor to assess the course requirements for specific local CSUs and to validate which CSUs are considered local.  \n\t \nThe new degree has been approved by Foothill's curriculum committee.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Judy Miner\nAdditional contact names:\n Kimberlee Messina, Isaac Escoto\nIs backup provided?\n Yes\n\t \n",

The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) decided to award these funds through a competitive application process to a district or group of districts to lead this initiative on behalf of the CCC system.\n\t \nOn September 3, 2013, the CCCCO released Request for Application #13-082 for the CCC Online Education Initiative (OEI). The RFA solicited applications from the field to lead the initiative to develop new and enhanced instruction and support systems in the following areas:\nAssociate Degree for Transfer (ADT) online\nOnline credit courses supporting the ADT\nOther online credit course\nSupport for online basic skills instruction\nSupport for credit by exam\nStudent support services including financial aid, counseling, advising, and orientation\nProfessional development for faculty and staff\nA common course management system and other integrated technology tools\nIn September, the FHDA senior leadership formed a partnership with the leadership of the Butte-Glenn Community College District to submit a joint application for the OEI grant. Butte is the system’s recognized leader in the development and management of the CCC infrastructure supporting online instruction and related services. Their technical experience was thought to be a solid complement to FHDA’s leadership in online instruction and student services.\n\t \nOn October 10, 2013, a joint application was submitted by FHDA and Butte in response to RFA #13-082. The applications were reviewed and scored by a panel of stakeholders from through the state, and the FHDA/Butte application was scored the highest. On October 28, 2013, the District was notified by the CCCCO of their intent to award this grant to FHDA as the lead agency.  On November 12, 2013, the CCC Board of Governors confirmed this award.\n\t \nFunding for the OEI grant will be available December 1, 2013, and activities related to the project will commence immediately. The initial funding of $16.9 million may be extended beyond June 30, 2014, for up to 48 months at a rate of $10 million per year.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJoseph Moreau, Vice Chancellor of Technology x6120\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",
