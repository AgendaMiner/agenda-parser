These agents send students overseas to undertake their college and university study. Over the past seven years, we employed the services of this contractor, Gregory Barattini, who helped us to significantly increase the number of relationships we maintain with agents all over China, Indonesia, the rest of Southeast Asia and Europe. This expansion was a strong factor in past years in the District being able to increase international student enrollment  despite the very challenging economic environment. In addition, the contractor helped reduce the District's travel expenses by representing us at many international study abroad fairs and exhibitions.\n\t \nThis contract would extend the services of Gregory Barattini for a one-year period starting July 1st. Mr. Barattini is a recognized professional expert and is one of few individuals known to the Foothill and De Anza International Programs Offices who provides this kind of international student recruitment representation to colleges and universities. For years, he worked as the senior vice president for marketing at several large international language school chains, recently represented Santa Monica College in a similar capacity over a four-year period, and has done an excellent job for FHDA over the past seven years. His clients also include Berkeley Colleges in New York City and UCLA Extension. He fully understands what the District has to offer and how to market us abroad, and is on a first-name  basis with a very large number of advising agents around the world. In addition, he is physically located in Indonesia, which allows him to travel inexpensively throughout the region and saves us considerable expenses.\n\t \nThe contractor will provide year-round recruitment representation in Southeast and South Asia, in Turkey and in Scandinavia. Specifically, he will:\n•     Develop relationships for FHDA with additional new educational  advising  agents;\n•     Strengthen  relationships with existing agents;\n•     Provide representation  at large study abroad fairs and agent seminars; and\n•     Provide ongoing recruitment and international marketing advice.\n\t \nThe contractor will provide these services to FHDA and to one or two other institutions, which will equally share in travel and related expenses. He will not represent any other community  college.\n\t \nThe contractor will be paid $3,800.00 per month and will invoice us for the District's share of his travel expenses, which will not exceed $50,000.00 for the academic year.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nJudy C.

The Preconstruction Services Agreement, paragraph VII(C), provides that the contractor will be reimbursed at actual cost for reimbursable services and is defined (in Phase 2) as providing Subcontractor’s engineered design support for the replacement of the raised floors and for the replacement of the Halon fire suppression system – both of which require design completion along with submission and approvals from the Division of the State Architect (DSA). Swinerton proposed and District staff agreed that Swinerton’s reimbursable services for this engineered design support effort is estimated at $7,500 but should not exceed $10,000. The total not-to-exceed cost for the Preconstruction Services Agreement was established at $56,540.\n\t \nIt is intended that some of the necessary work of Phase 2 can be included in Phase 1 – utilizing the “Bridging Allowance” established in Phase 1 for this effort - with Swinerton’s assistance. Swinerton also will commence working with the Architect to complete the plans and Specifications for Phase 2 and then bid the work to generate an acceptable GMP for Phase 2. The District will then submit the GMP for Phase 2 to the Board for review, and if approved, Swinerton will sign amended Lease Agreements for Phase 2 work and will commence work based on the agreed-upon schedule. All of the remaining Phase 2 work is anticipated to start construction as early as late Summer 2015 immediately after Phase 1 has been completed to minimize costs and limit disruption of services in the L-7 vicinity.

(Industrial Coating).  \n\t \nThe District received a bid protest from OnPoint Construction on April 16, 2015 citing that Industrial Coating did not comply with the “minimum requirements of the Districts Mandatory Walk through criteria” because Industrial Coating arrived when the Mandatory Walk Through was effectively over and the group was departing.  The District acknowledges that a representative from Industrial Coating did arrive approximately 45 minutes into the job walk near its conclusion. \n\t \nThe Notice to Contractors states “the District will conduct a mandatory Job-Walk for all contractors for the Work.  The Job-Walk will be conducted beginning at 10:30 a.m. on 3/17/2015” and the Instructions for Bidders states that “the failure of any Bidder to have its authorized representative present at the Mandatory Job-Walk will render the Bid Proposal of such Bidder to be non-responsive.”  Industrial Coating did have an authorized representative at the Job walk. Therefore, it met the minimum requirement stated by the District.  Purchasing staff also consulted with the District’s legal representative, Mr. Phillip Jaret of Jaret & Jaret Attorneys at Law.  It is the opinion of Mr. Jaret that the bid submitted by Industrial Coating is legally compliant and the contractor fulfilled the Mandatory Walk Through Criteria in Document 00 21 13 – Instructions to Bidders.  \n\t \nIndustrial Coating has confirmed that its bid price of $135,000 is true and accurate for the work as specified. Alternates #1 and #4 will not be accepted at this time; however, if the campus identifies additional funding for such work, then the bid specifications provide that the alternate can be accepted at a later date at the same cost provided in the bid proposal.  Industrial Coating has also performed work for Inland Empire Utilities, U.S. Forestry, and Lake Casitas Water District. \n\t \nThe bid price of $135,000 will be paid for with Campus Center funds and also Measure C funds.  Alternates #1 and #4 will not be accepted at this time; however, if the campus identifies additional funding for such work, then the bid specifications provide that the alternate can be accepted at a later date at the same cost provided in the bid proposal. \n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey - x6166\nAdditional contact names:\n  Art Heinrich - x6295, Gina Bailey - 6165\nIs backup provided?\n  Yes\n\t \n",
