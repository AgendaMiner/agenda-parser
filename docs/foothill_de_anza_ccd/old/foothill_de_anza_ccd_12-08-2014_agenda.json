The microturbines produce energy to heat the swimming pools and provide electricity to the campuses.\n\t \nTo ensure proper turbine performance and life, the units require regular, proper maintenance according to the manufacturer's recommended practices. Capstone has a prescribed set of scheduled maintenance items that must be followed.  The maintenance agreement with Capstone Turbine Corporation expired on June 30, 2014.\n\t \nIn 2010, Capstone elevated its California partner, Regatta Solutions (Regatta), from a sales representative to a full distributor that sells, installs, and services all Capstone microturbine energy products.  Capstone has since subcontracted the maintenance of the Districts’ eight microturbines to Regatta.  Currently Regatta is the exclusive Capstone approved distributer for California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii (see attached).\n\t \nSince Regatta is the manufacturer’s only distributor that can provide maintenance service on the microturbines in California there is no public benefit in conducting an advertised competitive sealed bid process; Regatta Solutions would be the only qualified bidder.  The five (5) year maintenance price from Regatta for all eight (8) microturbines in accordance with Capstone’s Standard Maintenance Schedule is $384,286.20 ($192,143.10 per campus over five years).  The plan includes scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, parts and labor, software updates and engine overhauls at 40,000 hours run time. Regatta’s proposal has been reviewed by Purchasing staff and Plant Services staff; compared to previous Capstone contracts staff believe that the rates for the proposed services are fair and reasonable.\n\t \nThe expense for this maintenance is offset by the utility savings from the microturbines and is paid for out of the District utility budget.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Ext 6166\nAdditional contact names:\n  Steve Kitchen, Ext 6150 Lester Lyons, Ext 6153, Gina Bailey, Ext. 6165\nIs backup provided?\n  No\n\t \n",

The scope of work includes door hardware replacement and select door replacement for existing theater while building remains fully occupied.  Improvement will be made on lower, main, and mezzanine levels and consist of new locks, cylinders, cores, and miscellaneous hardware.  Alternates #1 and #2 includes providing and installing new fiber reinforced polyester (FRP) doors and hardware. Project is anticipated to start construction in the middle of March 2015 and complete construction in early April 2015. \n\t \nProdis Associates Architects prepared the construction documents and a complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department. \n\t \nBid #1707-120 was legally advertised to contractors October 2, 2014, and October 8, 2014.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  A mandatory bid walk was held on Oct. 22, 2014, and a total of seven (7) contractors attended the walk.  Bids were publicly opened and read on November 5, 2014 in the Purchasing Services office.  Five (5) contractors submitted a bid and the bid results are summarized below:\n\t \nGeneral Contractors\nBase Bid Proposal Amount Includes $10,000 Allowance 1\nAlternate 1\nAlternate 2\nTotal Base Bid Proposal Amount Plus Alternates 1 & 2 \nRodan Builders, Inc.\n$96,000\n$6,600\n$7,800\n$110,400\nER Brothers Company, Inc.\n$99,440\n$11,600\n$12,700\n$123,740\nR.C.
