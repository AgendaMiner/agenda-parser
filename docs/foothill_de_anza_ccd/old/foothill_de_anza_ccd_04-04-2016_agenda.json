SVHTAI’s primary partners are Mission College (public) and Synopsys Inc. (private). Additional partners include five other community colleges in Silicon Valley (Cabrillo College, De Anza College, Evergreen College, Foothill College, and West Valley College) serving nearly 130,000 students over five counties, Santa Cruz County Workforce Investment Board, NOVA Workforce Development, San Jose Silicon Valley Workforce Investment Board (work2future), Cisco Systems, Palo Alto Networks, Plantronics, NetApp and Granite Rock. \n\t \nSVHTAI will administer two registered apprenticeships in the high-tech industry sector of Silicon Valley aimed at meeting the needs of regional employers and the local population. Ongoing prevalent demand for H1B visa holders in the region characterizes a “skills gap” in Silicon Valley. High Tech companies are understandably compelled to cast a wider net for talent to stay competitive and relevant. The two proposed apprenticeships, Computer User Support Specialist (aka Help Desk Specialist) and Data Center Technician, will create new access points for community college students into these companies. Once on board, inspired and talented entry-level people can rise from modest beginnings to attain positions that could eventually displace their H1B peers. These college enrollees represent a diverse population including African American, Hispanic, female, and veteran residents. Through these apprenticeships and extensive collaboration with industry partners and social services agencies, SVHTAI will formalize new entry points for students into high-demand, high-tech professions that help them enter the middle class. \n\t \nThe initial SVHTAI apprenticeship programs will serve at least three hundred students over thirty key employers in the Silicon Valley. As these initial programs demonstrate success for all participants, SVHTAI foresees an accelerated formation of other entry level apprenticeships as our the pool of trusted employer partners grows and they realize this responsive apprenticeship model will dramatically reduce their recruitment, hiring, and training costs over time. Success will catalyze sustainability.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nFoothill College Interim President Kimberlee Messina ext.7200 & De Anza College President Brian Murphy, ext. 8705\nAdditional contact names:\nDavid Ellis, Foothill Apprenticeship Administration x7142.

                    "item_details": "\nBackground and Analysis:\n\t \nWhen contracting for public works construction, the District is currently subject to traditional bidding procedures pursuant to Public Contract Code 20651, which states that “The Governing Board shall let any contract for a public project to the lowest responsible bidder who shall give security as the Board requires, or else reject all bids.”  Public projects are the construction; reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation, improvement, demolition, and repair work involving any publicly owned or leased facility including painting or re-painting.\n \nThe California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (CUPCCAA) is a program created in 1983 by the State Legislature (PCC 22000 et al.), which allows local agencies to award public project work through alternative Informal Bidding Procedures in an effort to expedite public works projects, yet maintain the spirit of open accountability and competitiveness. CUPCCAA simplifies the bidding process for smaller projects and speeds up contract award process because the Board can delegate the authority to enter into CUPCCAA contracts up to the limits set forth in PCC 22032, currently $175,000. CUPCCAA also allows District staff to perform small projects up to $45,000 and it provides the authority to enter into contracts for “emergency” work as defined in Public Contract Code Section 1102 up to the CUPCCAA limits.\n  \nImplementing the CUPCCAA program results in (1) improved timeliness of project completion, (2) simplified and decreased costs of administration, (3) lowered soft costs, and ultimately (4) the delivery of repaired and/or improved teaching and learning facilities to students and staff sooner than traditional bidding methods for public projects.  Projects that are let under CUPCCAA are still public projects that are subject to the payment of prevailing wages, requirements of payment bonds for work $25,000 or more, Change Order limitations, the Field Act approvals required by the Division of the State Architects office (DSA), and Department of Industrial Relations contractor registration and reporting requirements.\n\t \nCUPCCAA is an elective program, however if the District elects to be subject to the CUPCCAA procedures as set forth in PCC 22034, then it becomes subject to those procedures for all of its public work projects, including repairs and maintenance as defined in PCC 20656 unless specifically excluded. Additionally, an agency may withdraw from the CUPCCAA program at any time by filing a resolution of such election with the State Controller's Office.  \nAs required by CUPCCAA, the Purchasing Services department has developed internal informal bidding guidelines to successfully implement the program and assure compliance with the informal bidding requirements of the “Cost Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual” of the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission, including Contractor notification requirements.\n\t \nOnce a local agency has adopted CUPCCAA, it may procure repair, maintenance, and public works projects as follows:\n\t \n(a) Repair, maintenance and public projects of $45,000 or less may be performed by force account, negotiated contract, or purchase order (PCC 22032(a)). \n(b) Repair, maintenance and public projects of $175,000 or less may be let to contract by the informal procedures set forth in the Act (PCC 22032(b)).\n(c) Repair, maintenance and public projects of more than $175,000 shall be let to contract by formal bidding procedures (PCC 22032(c)). \n\t \nAs of January 12, 2016, forty-two (42) community college districts have adopted CUPCCAA including neighboring Districts such as San Mateo CCD, Cabrillo CCD, Chabot-Las Positas CCD, Contra Costa CCD, Ohlone CCD, and West Valley-Mission CCD. Other participating agencies include three hundred sixty-seven (367) K-12 school districts, several other local agencies, and special districts.\n\t \nDistrict staff recommend that the Board of Trustees approve the attached resolution to adopt the CUPCCAA program. Upon execution of the resolutions, staff will then proceed with notifying the State Controller of its desire to adopt CUPCCAA.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6202\nAdditional contact names:\n Pam Grey, Director, Purchasing, x6166\nIs backup provided?\n Yes\n\t \n",

It was determined that there would be no public benefit in conducting a formal competitive bid for the purchase since Sky-Skan would be the only qualified bidder.  The Board further authorized upgrades to the computers and DigitalSky 2 software to operate the system on August 29, 2011. The equipment was specially configured and integrally designed for the DigitalSky Planetarium and Multimedia system and replaced aging equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nThis request is for the upgrade and customization of the two Sony video projectors and Definiti lenses that are integral components of the DigitalSky system.  The equipment is aging as the projectors are nine year old and have more than 7800 hours of use on them. They have recently shown signs of over-heating and the projection images are dimming on the dome and deteriorating in quality, thus affecting the overall quality of the shows.  Since the video projectors and lenses are integral components of the DigitalSky Planetarium and Multimedia system, the only source for these items is through Sky-Skan, Inc.  The total cost of the equipment, including all necessary equipment, programming, software, projector installation, and training is $302,850 plus applicable taxes and shipping. The District also has the option of trading in the existing equipment for a credit of $5,000 per projector.  The system will be purchased with Community Education/Planetarium funds and also PSME/Instruction funds.\n\t\t\t\t\t \nSubmitted by:\nPam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\nChristina Espinosa-Pieb – x8940, Marisa Spatafore – x8672, Gina Bailey – x6165\nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

All bids received were much higher than anticipated and two Contractors did not include a significant portion of work in their bids. Therefore, based upon District staff recommendations, on February 8th the Board of Trustees rejected all bids received.  District staff’s intention was to rework the bid specifications with its engineer, McCracken & Woodman, in efforts to reduce costs and re-bid the work to install the chiller as soon as possible.\n\t \nIn order for the chiller to be installed prior to the summer months, the scope of work has been split into two phases. This project is the first phase of work, requiring the Contractor to install a District-owned chiller before the warm summer weather begins.  A second phase, to replace the water pumps, upgrade the electrical, and replace piping, will be bid and undertaken when cool weather returns, when cooling water from the chiller is not needed. \n\t \nThe bid was legally advertised to contractors on February 23 and March 1, 2016 in the San Jose Post Record/Daily Journal. Several Builders Exchanges and Contractors also received notification that they could receive bid documents through the FHDA portal of the PlanetBids website which is available by selecting \"Bid Opportunities\" at purchasing.fhda.edu.  Bids were publicly opened and read on March 17, 2016 in the Purchasing Services office. Three (3) contractors submitted bids. Bid results are below:\nBID RESULTS\nContractor\nTotal Base Bid \nProposal Amount\nHeathorn Associates Contractors, Inc. dba American Air Conditioning, Plumbing, and Heating Co.\n$ 61,943\nEnvironmental Systems, Inc. of Northern California\n$69,000\nO. C. McDonald Co., Inc.\n$98,069\n\t \nThe apparent low bidder is American Air Conditioning, Plumbing, and Heating Co.  Furthermore, American  Air Conditioning confirmed that its bid price of $61,943 for the Total Base Bid Proposal Amount is true and accurate for the work as specified and it confirmed that all first tier subcontractors were listed. American Air Conditioning will self-perform any non-listed work. American Air Conditioning successfully completed projects for other public agencies including Mission San Jose High School and Bay Area Rapid Transit agency (BART).\n\t \nThe bid price from American Air Conditioning of $61,943 is within the estimated value of the reduced scope of work.  This project will be funded by Measure C project 405, ETS Projects, but state scheduled maintenance funding may be used as well, if it becomes available due to low bids on other projects.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Pam Grey, Director of Purchasing Services, x6166\nAdditional contact names:\n  Steve Kitchen, Art Heinrich, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n  No\n\t \n",
