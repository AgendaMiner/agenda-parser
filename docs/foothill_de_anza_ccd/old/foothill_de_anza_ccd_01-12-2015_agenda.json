The capital outlay rate was set at $17, for a total of $149 per quarter unit (applicable to all non-resident students).\n\t \nFor 2015/16, the statewide rate is $133 per quarter unit compared to the district rate of $135 as per the calculations on page 1 of the attached worksheet. Under these circumstances, the district has the following options:\n\t \n1. Set the rate at the statewide average rate of $133 (plus capital)\n\t \n2. Set the rate at the district average rate of $135 (plus capital)\n\t \n3. Option 3, as specified under Education Code Section 76140, cannot be exercised as FHDA enrollment in non-credit courses is below 10%\n\t \n4. Set the rate to equal the rate of a contiguous district (plus capital)\n\t \n5. No more than district average cost, no less than the state average cost (plus capital)\n\t \n6. Set the rate at ‘highest years statewide average tuition.’ This rate is calculated to be $133 per quarter unit (plus capital)\n\t \n7. Set the rate at no greater than the 2013/14 average non-resident tuition fee of public community colleges in a minimum of 12 states comparable to California in cost of living. This average is calculated to be $253 per quarter unit (plus capital)\n\t \nUpon analysis of these options, and in discussion with the Dean of International Programs, it is recommended that the base rate be set at $135 (Option 2) for 2015/16, or $3 more than in 2014/15.\n\t \nThe 2015/16 non-resident student capital outlay fee should not exceed the lesser of $23 per quarter unit (see calculation on page 2 of the attached worksheet) or 50% of the adopted 2014/15 nonresident tuition fee of $132, or $66.  We are recommending that the capital outlay fee for 2015/16 be set at $17, the same as for 2014/15.  Note: Since fiscal year 2010/11, AB 947 amended EC 76141 to enable community college districts to charge all non-resident students a capital outlay fee, not only those students who were both citizens and residents of a foreign country.\n\t \nIn summary, the rate for all non-resident students will be $135 base rate plus $17 capital rate for a total of $152 per quarter unit, representing a $3 increase over the 2014/15 rate.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n Kevin McElroy, Vice Chancellor, Business Services, x6202\nAdditional contact names:\n Joni Hayes, Director, Budget Operations, x6261\nIs backup provided?\n Yes\n\t \n",

The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builder’s exchanges and advertised in the Daily Pacific Builder as well as posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  Bids were publicly opened and read on December 11, 2014, in the Purchasing Services office. Four (4) contractors submitted bids.

(Pullman), was incomplete in that the fields that required the contractor’s license classification number and expiration date as defined in Paragraph 4 of the bid form were left blank. Purchasing staff immediately confirmed that Pullman’s contractor’s license was valid on the California Contractor’s State License Board website and requested that Pullman complete the form and resubmit. It is the opinion of the Director of Purchasing Services, Pam Grey, that this minor omission and the immediate correction can be waived as a minor irregularity. The contract documents state “the District reserves the right to reject any or all Bid Proposals or to waive any irregularities or informalities in any Bid Proposal or in the bidding.” \n\t \nFurthermore, Pullman confirmed that its bid price of $625,000 is true and accurate for the work as specified and it confirmed that all first tier subcontractors were listed.
