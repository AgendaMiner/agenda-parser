Under Proposition 13, industrial, commercial, and residential property are treated the same. When Proposition 13 passed in 1978, 40 percent of property taxes in California were paid by commercial property owners, but that percentage has been reduced to 28 percent over time. Evolve estimates that an additional $6 billion per year would be available to fund public schools and services if the proposal to reassess commercial properties more often were enacted.\n\t \nAt the July 7, 2014, regular meeting of the Board of Trustees, a resolution drafted by Evolve was presented for discussion. According to Evolve's web site, four community college districts have adopted resolutions supporting the effort as have a number of K-12 school districts and city councils. The governing board expressed general support for Proposition 13 reform but expressed concern regarding some of the assertions made in the resolution. Board members also questioned whether community colleges would benefit from reform or if additional property tax income generated would be offset by Proposition 98.  Trustees Barram and Casas agreed to revise the resolution based on feedback received at the meeting.  The revised draft is attached for the governing board's consideration.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\nLinda Thor\nAdditional contact names:\n\t\t\t\t\t \nIs backup provided?\nYes\n\t \n",

Janecki Associates prepared the final bid specifications for the work.  A complete set of all bid documents are on file in the Purchasing Services Department. \n\t \nThe bid was legally advertised to contractors on June 10 and June 17, 2014.  The “Invitation to Bid” was also sent to nine (9) builders’ exchanges, advertised in the San Jose Post Record, and posted on “BidNet” at www.govbids.com.  A mandatory bid walk was held on June 24, 2014, and a total of nine (9) potential contractors attended the walk.  Bids were publicly opened and read on July 16, 2014 by Purchasing Services.  One contractor submitted a bid and the bid result is summarized below:\nBID RESULTS\n\t \nContractor\nBase Bid Proposal Amount:\nGuerra Construction Group\n$730,400\n\t \nPurchasing staff reached out to the eight (8) other contractors who attended the mandatory bid walk.  The general consensus is that the project is very challenging, additionally contractors in this field of work are overwhelmed with other less challenging projects and are bidding projects that are more attractive. Furthermore, it is not recommended that the bid be rejected and rebid at a later time. Previous attempts at awarding this project have been unsuccessful. Rebidding the project is not likely to result in a cost savings; rather staff is concerned that costs may likely continue to increase due to the improvements in the economy.  \n\t \nGuerra Construction Group (Guerra) has confirmed that its bid price is correct and accurate.  Furthermore, Guerra, and its listed subcontractors, have signed the “Agreement to be Bound” of the Project Stabilization/Construction Careers Agreement between the District and the Santa Clara & San Benito Counties Building Trades Council.  Guerra has recently completed campus improvements at De Anza College.\n\t \nThe bid submitted by Guerra exceeds the landscape architect’s construction estimate and the construction budget of $390,000.  Therefore, the construction bond management team (Gilbane, purchasing staff, bond management, architect) met with Guerra to understand how its bid pricing was developed, to confirm that the scope of work was reflective of the bid specifications, to identify any site conditions that can be modified in efforts to reduce cost, and to identify any scopes of work that can be removed or altered to reduce the final costs of work.  Guerra shared that the site conditions are a primary reason for the cost for the work; there are several trees that require protection, work is limited to confined spaces that require smaller and slower equipment, there is an extensive amount of manual labor involved to perform the work, and there is no viable location for stockpiling of materials, dirt, etc. Therefore, through a process called “value engineering” the team and Guerra were able to identify potential savings in the aggregate amount of $143,000 by making the changes proposed below:\n\t \nCredit - $37,000 – increase the staging area\nCredit - $38,000 – additional capacity for trucking needs\nCredit - $23,000 – more accessibility\nCredit - $36,000 – larger equipment in lieu of smaller\nCredit - $15,000 – reduce irrigation handwork\nAdd - $6,000 – remove trees to provide access for large equipment\n\t \nIn accordance with PCC 20651(b), the governing board shall let any contract for a public project to the lowest responsible bidder, or reject all bids.  Therefore, the award to Guerra must be authorized based upon its bid amount of $730,400.  However, after award, it is the Districts intent to revise the contract and issue deductive change orders in the aggregate amount of $143,000.  The project will be funded through De Anza College Measure C budget transfer #45 in addition to Measure C project funds.\n\t \nSubmitted by:\n  Director of Purchasing Services - Pam Grey\nAdditional contact names:\n  Art Heinrich, Tom Armstrong, Donna Jones Dulin, Gina Bailey\nIs backup provided?\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n",
