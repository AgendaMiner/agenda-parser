Brothers holds California Contractors Licenses A, B, C-16, and C-16.  Approximately 18% of the work required on the project is mechanical work related to the HVAC system.  District staff investigated the intentions of E. R. Brothers’ methodology and performance of the mechanical scope of work and consulted with its legal counsel, Mr. Phillip Jaret of Jaret & Jaret Attorneys at Law, Mr. Michael Vlamming of Scarth Lyons & Associates, and also the California Department of Industrial Relations – Public Works Department.  District staff and its legal counsel concluded that the methodology described by E. R. Brothers satisfies the legal requirements to self-perform the work and recommend that the protest (see attached) be denied and the contract be awarded to E. R. Brothers.  \n\t \nIn 2013, E. R.
