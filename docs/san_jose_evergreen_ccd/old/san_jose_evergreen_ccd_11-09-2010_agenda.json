However, the district made a commitment to pay $136,260 for its participation in the second year; and the district has recently been billed for $130,000 (a slight reduction from the original amount requested in the MOU.) Because district administration did not receive prior Board approval of the MOU, it is recommended the Board approve the attached MOU with the Lumina Foundation for Education and also approve the payment of $130,000.\n",
