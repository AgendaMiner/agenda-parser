Our April 22, 2015 Accreditation Follow-Up Report indicated that we utilize a three-year pilot program between the FA, AFT 6157 (Union) and the San Jose Evergreen Community College District (District) regarding the recommendations of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) that Student Learning Outcomes (SLO’s) be a component of faculty evaluations was not deemed by the Commissioners as meeting the Standard.  As the District and Union were not currently involved in negotiations, this pilot program was not a contract proposal. The three-year pilot program was an interim measure designed for the limited purposes of addressing the ACCJC’s requirements until the issues addressed in the pilot program was are negotiated between the District and the Union. The District and the Union agreed to the pilot program being in effect from Fall 2014 through Spring 2017 to coincide with the faculty evaluation cycle.\n\t \n2. Academic Administrators - Board Approval of Consent Agenda  Item F-7 of April 8, 2014 – “Revisions to Academic Administrator Job Descriptions and Performance Appraisal Form to Address Responsibility for the Systematic Assessment of Student Progress and Learning Outcomes” and the proposed evaluation form.  \n\t \n3. At the February 10, 2015 Governing Board meeting a recommendation was made that the Board of Trustees approve the District and Federation of Teachers, AFT 6157 tentative agreements.  And as part of that agreement a component to assess Student Learning Outcomes has been added to the faculty evaluation process, Article 19, 19a – 22.  This officially eliminates the three-year pilot program referenced in item #1 above and addresses the compliance with Standard III.A.1c. and Eligibility Requirement 21 (Integrity in Relations with the Accrediting Commission).\n \n\t \n",
