Consensus was reached in several areas including goals clarification, legal liabilities and compliance, differentiation between principles and policies, recommended format and next steps. The goal clarification was determined to develop and implement a governance policy model that ensures the effective and efficient participation of Trustees, including a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities among Trustees; differentiation of role and function between Trustees and the Chancellor and the commitment to ongoing evaluation of board performance and Chancellor accountability. Mr. Randy Parent proposed that the Board establish a set of Principles (developed by the Board), followed by the Policies Manual (developed for Board approval by the Chancellor through participatory governance) and followed by an Administrative Procedures Manual (developed by staff). Therefore, it is suggested that the current language derived from the Carver Policy Governance Model should be reclassified as Principles, i.e. a higher order of value that applies to the Board members in the performance of their work. In addition, Board Policies should remain as they are in Chapters I through VII (BP 1100 to BP 7700). The Board Governance Task Force also recommended the development of a document that includes the Board Mission, Vision and Values Statements, Board Ends Policies, Strategic Priorities for 2013-2017, Board Governance Principles and Administrative Procedures. The next steps will include a revision of the governance model adoption calendar, creation of the framework for the new agenda format and the establishment of an implementation date.  \n\t \nThe task force met once again with Mr. Randy Parent on March 31, 2014, to review his draft of the document that was revised using the criteria reported to the board at the March 11 meeting.

Recent high school graduates, under-employed and unemployed adults, incumbent workers looking for career advancement, and college graduates seeking retraining are all benefiting from reinvigorated CTE programs that offer clear pathways from shorter-term, entry-level to longer term, industry validated credentials in their chosen fields.  On the state level, industry-aligned CTE programs are helping California meet completion goals, reach workforce goals, meet equity goals, and realize the benefits of high school reform efforts.\n\t \nThe goal of this presentation is to review new, external information recently available at the national, state, and local level that are major drivers for Career & Technical Education efforts occurring at San Jose City College.  The presentation may inform future policy decisions needed to follow step with community colleges around the state, reinvigorating CTE and workforce development programs and ensuring their relevance to local industry and to students.  A brief overview of San Jose City College’s self-evaluation of their CTE and workforce development preparedness will also be presented. \n \nThe San Jose/Evergreen Community College District has also been invited to participate on the advisory board for the City of San Jose Silicon Valley Manufacturing Initiative in its effort to seek federal designation as a “Manufacturing Community” as will be presented by Chris Burton, Business Development Manager for the City of San Jose Office of Economic Development.\n \nNeil Struthers, Business Development Officer for the National Electrical Contractors Association will present on his efforts to provide apprenticeship opportunities for SJCC students and to create clearly defined career pathways into construction and related industries. \n \n\t \n",
