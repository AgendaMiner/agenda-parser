The Facilities Master Plans are intended to provide a guide for future campus development utilizing current and future funding as it is realized. \n\t \nThe updated Facilities Master Plans detail physical changes to the Colleges that have occurred since the previous master plans and delineate proposed additional physical changes to the Colleges that may occur by the end of 2025 through implementation of these plans.  This includes buildings and facilities that will be demolished, constructed or renovated, as well as comprehensive views of circulation, way finding, landscape, and infrastructure.  These updated plans represent the outcome of collaborative, inclusive processes facilitated by both colleges under the leadership of their respective Presidents and Vice Presidents. The process included the review and participation of faculty, staff, administrators and community members who provided valuable insight and suggestions throughout the development of the plans. Gilbane Building Company and HMC Architects were engaged to assist the Colleges and to facilitate the process.\n \n\tVice President Henry Gee will present on the process and proposed revisions to the EVC Facilities Master Plan.

This process adheres to the accountability standards outlined by Proposition 39 and provides transparency in the evolution of the project list. \n\t \nThis Bond List Revision reflects the collaborative efforts by the Bond Management Team to plan and prioritize Measure G-2010 Bond projects at San Jose City College and Evergreen Valley College. These project revisions are the result of careful coordination and realignment with the current Facilities Master Plans and the planned implementation of the projects at each campus. The project revisions included in this Bond List Revision have been vetted and approved through the shared governance processes at each college.\n\t \nMeasure G-2010 Bond List Revision #1 includes the following project revisions:\n\t \nSan Jose City College Project List Revisions:\nProject 31105 Renovate Building K: The College has determined to renovate Building K as a new home for Maintenance & Operations in lieu of building a new facility. The name and budget for this project have been revised to reflect the intended scope.\nProject 31106 Renovate - General Education Building: The current Facilities Master Plan includes a new GE facility, however the College has determined that with some minor improvements, the life of the existing GE facility can be extended several more years until funding is available to replace it. This project is being removed from the Bond List, but the College intends to incorporate certain mechanical and finish upgrades to the existing facility into Project 31304 Scheduled Maintenance.\nProject 31107 Theater-Drama & Speech Bldg: A recent Facilities Condition Assessment of the existing Theater building indicates that this facility would be costly to renovate and would still not improve some aspects of the facilities’ functionality and efficiency. The College has decided to build a new facility per the current Facilities Master Plan in lieu of renovating the existing facility. The changes to this project’s name and budget reflect the College's current intent for the scope of this project.\nProject 31108 100-200-Boiler Plant Demo & New Parking Lot: The demolition of the 300 Building has been removed from the scope of this project and the demolition of the Boiler Plant and a new parking lot have been added to reflect the intent of the current Facilities Master Plan and the planned sequence of implementation of the bond projects. \nProject 31109 Demolition:  Boiler Plant: The scope and budget for this project have been consolidated with Project 31108.\nProject 31304 Scheduled Maintenance: The intent of this project remains to provide funding for various maintenance related projects over a 10 year period. This project revision shortens and simplifies the name of the project.\nProject 31305 Energy Efficiency - Photovoltaic: The intent of this project is to provide increased energy efficiency and to offset the cost of future energy related utility bills. Although the scope and budget for this project has been consolidated with Project 31113, the budget amount associated with this transfer is dedicated to the installation of a Photovoltaic or other District approved alternative energy generation system. \nProject 31111 Exterior Lighting Phase II, 31117 Landscaping, 31118 Irrigation, 31119 Hardscape & 31120 Wayfinding: The scope and budget for these site related projects have been combined into one new project, Project 31116 Campus Site Improvements, to gain efficiency, economy of scale and to accommodate a holistic approach in developing a comprehensive and consistent design for the campus wide site improvements. \nProject: 31113 Vocational Technology Bldg: This new project as identified in the current Facilities Master Plan is noted as one of the College’s highest priorities. This new facility is required due to the planned demolition of the 100-200-300 buildings that currently house the Vocational Technology programs. Scope and budget from Project 31305 has been consolidated into this project; this transferred scope and budget is intended to remain dedicated to the installation of a Photovoltaic or other District approved alternative energy generation system. \nProject: 31114 Demo 300: This new project has been budgeted in accordance with the intended scope, separated from Project 31108 and established as a unique project due to the planned implementation sequence of the bond projects. \nProject: 31115 Theater Demo & New Parking Lot: This new project includes the demolition of the existing theater and associated site improvements once it is removed. These elements are planned as a separate project once the new theater is complete. \nProject: 31116 Campus Site Improvements: This new project is a consolidation of several site related projects that were individually identified on the original Bond List including Project 31111 Exterior Lighting Phase II, 31117 Landscaping, 31118 Irrigation, 31119 Hardscape & 31120 Wayfinding: The benefits of combining these projects include the ability to take a holistic approach in the development of a comprehensive and consistent design for campus wide site improvements including walkways, landscape, irrigation and lighting.\nProject 39905 Management and Related Costs (3% of const hard costs): This budget line item was originally established for Program and Construction Management services at 12% of the total construction budget, with Program Management services accounting for 3% and Construction Management services accounting for 9% of the total Construction Budget. The Bond Executive Team has made the determination to retain the 3% budget allocation for Program Management services in this line item and to reallocate the remaining 9% for Construction Management services to the projects.\n\t \nAs part of this distribution, the following projects received amounts equal to 9% of their currently forecasted Construction \n31107, 31108, 31110, 31304, 31307, 31308, 31112, 31321, 31113, 31114, 31115, 31116, 31311\nProject 31199 Campus Contingency: Received the balance of the 9% Construction Management budget not allocated to the above noted projects.\nProject 31311 Physical Security: The scope and budget for this project has been adjusted to reflect the College’s current needs and intended scope related to increasing physical security on campus.\n\t \n\t \nEvergreen Valley College Project List Revisions:\nProject 32105 New Campus Police Bldg: The District and College have determined that the campus police will remain in their existing facility in lieu of relocating to a new facility. This project is therefore not necessary, is being removed from the Bond List and the budget is being re-directed to address higher priority projects on this list.\nProject 32106 Engineering & Applied Technology: The Automotive Technology scope and budget have been removed from this project and established as a separate project. The name and budget for this project have been revised to reflect the currently intended scope.\nProject 32107 Science/Math Building(s): The GED4 scope and budget have been removed from this project and established as a separate project. The name and budget for this project have been revised to reflect the currently intended scope.\nProject 32108 Admin & Student Services Remodel & Consolidation: The name and budget for this project have been revised to reflect the currently intended scope.\nProject 32110 Demolition - Roble/Acacia: The budget for this project has been revised to reflect the current estimate for the intended scope of the project.\nProject 32306 Central Plant - Remodel: The name and budget for this project have been revised to reflect the intended scope and current estimate for the project.\nProject 32307 Scheduled Maintenance: The intent of this project remains to provide funding for various maintenance related projects over a 10 year period. This project revision shortens and simplifies the name of the project.\nProject 32308 Utilities Projects & Upgrades: This project revision includes a change to the project name only to more accurately align with the intended scope and budget. \nProject 32309 Exterior Lighting Upgrade Phase II: The scope and budget for this project have been consolidated with Project 32113.\nProject 32312 Vehicular Circulation, 32118 Hardscape- Circulation & Plazas, 32119 Landscaping, 32120 Irrigation & 32121 Wayfinding: The scope and budget for these site related projects have been combined into one new project, Project 32113 Campus Site Improvements, to gain efficiency, economy of scale and to accommodate a holistic approach in developing a comprehensive and consistent design for the campus wide site improvements. \nProject 32111 Autotech: The scope and budget for this project have been aligned with the intended scope, separated from Project 32106 and established as a unique new project due to the planned implementation sequence of the bond projects.\nProject 32112 GED 4: The scope and budget for this project have been aligned with the intended scope, separated from Project 32107 and established as a unique new project due to the planned implementation sequence of the bond projects.\nProject 32113 Campus Site Improvements: This new project is a consolidation of several site related projects that were individually identified on the original Bond List, including Project 32312 Vehicular Circulation, 32118 Hardscape- Circulation & Plazas, 32119 Landscaping, 32120 Irrigation & 32121 Wayfinding.
