The District Office will receive $166,493.27 for fiscal, budget and administrative integration.\n\t \nCommunity Colleges:  Each community college agrees to collaborate to meet the SVETP regional career pathways plan to implement 15 Information and Communications Technology pathways, 10 Engineering Technology pathways, and 6 Advanced Manufacturing pathways that will serve over 3460 students with exposure to hands-on work-based learning activities, and has a goal to assist over 500 students receive a state approve CTE Certificate.\n\t \nK-12 Districts / Alternative / Charter Schools:  In the SVETP region the number of K-12 students exposed to, exploring or enrolled in the STEM foundation related career pathways program will be approximately 7200 between  2015-2019.  Local USDs will collect data on the number of students enrolled in their career academies and other pathways, and will refine this data collection so that it aligns with the shared definition of \"career pathway programs\".\n\t \nCalifornia State Universities:  San Jose State, San Francisco State and CSU-East Bay are all joining the SVETP partnership to assist with marketing outreach, to employ Math Science Teaching Initiative (MSTI) students to assume the Student Support Specialist roles in sustainability outlier years, for their work experience stipend, and to provide professional development to STEM faculty and teachers. \n\t \nWorkforce Investment Boards (becoming Workforce Development Boards):  The SVETP region 3 WIBS, Alameda WIB, Nova and Work2Future, and all have experience working with the workforce intermediaries to link WIA/WIOA eligible students with WIOA funded work-experience opportunities in high-growth, high- demand, high-wage career areas that respond to the growing need for youth 16-24 to have industry recognized career skills and certification. \n\t \nWorkforce Intermediaries:  Growth Sector is the primary workforce intermediary, and will be responsible for identifying and securing employers to create the employer based, STEM focused/aligned internships in all three SVETP career pathways.  Additionally, Growth Sector, a STEM Core Network leader, has experience with different strategies for accelerating students’ remedial math and English skills, and therefore they will select and hire nine Student Support Specialists (SSSs), one for each community college, beginning 2015-2016.  The SSS is an integral pivot point for the STEM Core model.  In partnership with Growth Sector, Transmosis will define and develop a detailed STEM Bootcamp and Internship Program for community college students, particularly in small to mid-size businesses and with start-ups.  The Transmosis program is designed to enhance their STEM skills and provide an internship to gain exposure and experience in the technology industry.  The goal is to build an effective, sustainable program that can be scaled across the Silicon Valley region over four years.\n\t \nProfessional Development:  A significant outcome of SVETP will be state-of-the-art professional development for community college faculty and K-12 teachers.  TED-Ed’s mission is to amplify and share the ideas and voices of faculty, teachers and students around the world while supporting educators and students with video-based content, a web-based teaching tool, and professional development programming.  In particular, TED-Ed aims to collaborate with faculty and teachers to capture scalable, useful subject-based lessons that can be shared with the world for free. These lessons are produced with exceptional quality, crafted to inspire students to become more curious about all subject areas, and in particular, math, science and engineering topics.  \n\t \nAnd, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) is a critical partner in the SVETP career pathways project, an employer committed to this STEM foundation model, with paid internships, and as a professional development provider for faculty and teachers.  LLNL will have two specific program deliverables: 1) Advance Manufacturing Institute training for student/interns and teachers, operating as a boot camp with work-based learning (WBL) paid internships; and 2) management of the Advanced Manufacturing and STEM mobile learning laboratory that will provide WBL opportunities throughout the Silicon Valley region to over 2,000 K-12 and community college students. \n\t \nFormal Evaluator:  UCLA HERI (Higher Education Research Institute) was engaged so an external evaluation team can provide a more formal evaluation infrastructure to examine our local \"research questions\" that emerge as we review student and faculty/teacher data, and evaluate barriers and accelerants to student progress in STEM core and career pathway programs.\nBy June 30, 2018 the grant funds will be expended and all education partners, other partners and employers have committed $19,488,112 in In-Kind Match to sustain SVETP with the STEM Core, career pathways and availability of paid internships through June 30, 2019.\n",

These changes are limited to the bid limits or to 10 percent of the original contract price whichever is greater. These limits, according to the California Attorney General, \"…appear to be inserted to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would, in effect, constitute the making of a new contract.\"[1] Furthermore, it is in the Attorney General’s view that “… change orders are appropriately contemplated where, during the performances of the contract, unforeseen matters are discovered which require some modification to complete the contract.” 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 417 (1990).\n\t\t \nThe purpose of Sections 20118.4 and 20659 is to allow some flexibility following the award of the bid, and to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would constitute the making of a new contract. In effect, the change order provisions allow districts to negotiate changes to a contract provided the contract is not materially altered by the change order to such an extent that it would create a new project or contract which should be bid separately.  Public bidding of the increased scope of Work would not have produced an advantage to the District, and would produce a net burden and distinct disadvantages to the District. Based on the foregoing, it would be incongruous, futile, and unavailing to publicly bid the increased scope of Work.  \n\t\t \n\t\t \nThis change order has undergone District legal counsel review for compliance with Public Contract Code. \n\t\t \nThe PCO’s presented within Change Order No. 002 were unforeseen matters that were discovered during construction and could not be anticipated prior to contract award. Details of the PCO’s can be viewed on the attached (Board Agenda - Details - CO No. 002 - RC Benson.doc). These changes were a necessary and integral part of the work under the contact and the taking of bids would delay the completion of contract, which were required to be completed during the Summer 2015 school break.\n\t\t\t \n[1] 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen 417 (1990) footnote no. 3\n\t \n",
