Unforeseen conditions account for approximately $164,400.00 of the total cost of the changes, or 17.9% against the original contract. This change will be funded from project contingency established in the project budget in expectation of this type of change and from project savings to date.\n\t \nPursuant to Public Contract Code sections 20118.4 and 20659 (applicable to community college districts), a contract may be increased or decreased after the bid is awarded due to changes that might arise during the course of the contract. These changes are limited to the bid limits or to 10 percent of the original contract price whichever is greater. These limits, according to the California Attorney General, \"…appear to be inserted to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would, in effect, constitute the making of a new contract.\"[1] Furthermore, it is in the Attorney General’s view that “… change orders are appropriately contemplated where, during the performances of the contract, unforeseen matters are discovered which require some modification to complete the contract.” 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 417 (1990).\n\t \nThe purpose of Sections 20118.4 and 20659 is to allow some flexibility following the award of the bid, and to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would constitute the making of a new contract. In effect, the change order provisions allow districts to negotiate changes to a contract provided the contract is not materially altered by the change order to such an extent that it would create a new project or contract which should be bid separately.  Public bidding of the increased scope of Work would not have produced an advantage to the District, and would produce a net burden and distinct disadvantages to the District. Based on the foregoing, it would be incongruous, futile, and unavailing to publicly bid the increased scope of Work.  \n\t \nThis has undergone District legal counsel review for compliance with Public Contract Code. \n\t\t \n[1] 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen 417 (1990) footnote no. 3\n\t \n",

The proposed MOU was subsequently submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval at the December 8, 2015 meeting.  Upon approval, EVC received authorization to evaluate the feasibility of participation in the proposed exchanges and activities.\n\t \nAs the language in the proposed MOU indicates, it is to serve as a means to facilitate and develop a mutually beneficial process for collaboration. The language stated that it is not a binding contract and does not create any legal or financial relationship between the two institutions.\n \nIn evaluating the proposed activities, EVC concluded that participation would entail substantial expenditures, which are resources the college does not have. Further, EVC is not approved by the State Department as a sponsor of Educator Exchanges and cannot facilitate faculty exchanges. Consequently, EVC has not accepted the proposed MOU, has not signed the MOU, and will not enter into any formal partnership with the University of Danang. \n\t \nWith the evaluation now complete, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept EVC’s conclusions and rescind the approval previously granted December 8, 2015. \n\t \n",

A Proposition 39 Bond Measure is a recommended pathway to securing the necessary funding required to institute Vision 2030 throughout the District. Due to the timeframe required in advance of the November 8, 2016 Election, the planning process to initiate a Proposition 39 Bond Election would need to be activated very soon. Now is the time for the Board to begin discussions regarding interest in pursuing this effort.\n\t \nAttached is an outline of action and time frame from Bond Council.\n",

The goal of this presentation is to 1) share where District is in relation to the dashboard targets; 2) analyze the areas of strength and opportunities for improvement within the Ends Policies of Institutional Excellence and College Experience; and 3) set direction as to the areas of focus that should be the priority of the District as it relates to specified Ends Policies.  The Ends Policy Monitoring Report can support the District in making data-informed decisions and to establish priorities for the allocation fiscal and human resources to meet the goals measured in the Board Ends Policies.\n\t \nThe rating for Ends Policy #4: Institutional Excellence is 3.4, which is a B.  The primary indicators for this area deal with employee and student demographics as a proportion of the District's area demographics, employee and student rating of the institutional climate and satisfaction with feelings of worth and value, and employee satisfaction with district services.  Many of these items received strong scores against set targets and there are some opportunities for improvement.\n\t \nThe rating for Ends Policy #6: College Experience is 2.5.  When it comes to student and staff satisfaction with the campus environment, safety, and engagement, the indicators receive a rating of 2.0.  When students are asked about their engagement as far as the learning environment, the indicators receive a rating of 3.0.  \n\t \nThe Monitoring Report will go into more in-depth analysis into the trends related to these two ends policies.\n",
