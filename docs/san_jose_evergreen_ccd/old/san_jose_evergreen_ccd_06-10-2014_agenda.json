With the direction from the Board and Chancellor, this solicitation was developed by the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services; the Director of Facilities and Bond Program Management; the Assistant Director of Fiscal Services; the Director of Community Relations, EEO and Diversity; a Purchasing Agent, and representatives of Gilbane. The focus of the solicitation is to increase the participation of diverse small businesses, which includes minority- owned, women-owned, disabled veteran-owned and small businesses, to achieve the District’s 15% outreach goal with particular emphasis on the current Measure G-2010 construction activity. \n\t \nThe District received five proposals.  After consideration and review, the evaluation committee invited all five to be interviewed. Along with District staff and Gilbane, the evaluation committee included four community members representative of the District’s diverse population and active in the support of social and economic justice issues. By consensus, the evaluation committee recommended two vendors, L. Luster & Associates, Inc. and Enterprise Foundation, for consideration and a possible collaboration to achieve the District’s 15% outreach goal.  \n\t \nAlthough the contract is awaiting successful negotiations of terms, the recommendation is that the Board approve this agenda item to allow the District to enter into a contract with the selected vendor(s) immediately after the contract is finalized. This urgency is in the best interest to the District because time sensitive Measure G-2010 projects are being developed and the District would like to insert this dynamic into the process. A subsequent request for Board ratification will be brought to the Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, July 8, 2014 to formally announce the selected vendors and dollar amount of the proposal. \n",
