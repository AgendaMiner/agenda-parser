At that time Blach put the project out for subcontractor bidding and assembled the GMP.  However, a combination of market factors including increases for materials and high local construction demand have affected pricing.  Preparatory to the final GMP a significant effort was provided by college and District staff, Gilbane, HMC and its consultants and Blach to achieve the lowest project costs.  As a result of these efforts Blach has presented a GMP of $41,639,729.  While the overall project budget will support the value of this contract, efforts will continue through the course of construction to identify cost-savings measures to the project.  Please note that while this is a âguaranteedâ maximum price, the GMP is subject to adjustments for extra work and changes as directed by the District.  \n\t \nUpon execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease, Blach will be granted access to and control of the site to commence construction.  Completion of the construction will be achieved within 562 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.\n",

The evaluation criteria included structural soundness, ergonomic standards, functionality in the new location and color/style compatibility.  Savings to the District from re-using furniture is in the range of $200,000 to $250,000.   \nParking â This has been a high priority since the decision was made to move District operations downtown.  We have explored many options, including City parking garages, with distance from the new building and operating costs as important considerations.  Our current plan is to purchase monthly parking passes, for District employees, Trustees, campus leaders and constituency group leaders, at a private garage located at 60 S. Market, right across Post Street from the new office.  We plan to provide payment vouchers to invited guests and to the public for Board meetings.   Our objective is to make parking as affordable, convenient and safe as possible, for all participants in the work of the District. \nMoving - We are tentatively scheduling the physical move to 40 S. Market for the holiday break.  The actual move date will depend upon the actual completion of significant building systems such as data, audio visual and security.  We are monitoring these bid packages closely to assure a timely and successful relocation process. \nBudget - A budget and expense forecast report is enclosed with this information item.   \n\t \n\t \n",
