Twelve Statements of Qualifications (SOQ’s) were received.  A Selection Committee comprised of District and College faculty and staff reviewed, scored and ranked the SOQ’s, pre-qualified the five highest ranked firms and conducted in-person interviews with each firm. Each firm then received a score from the committee based on their presentations. Following the interviews and committee scoring and ranking, these five pre-qualified firms then submitted sealed proposals for lump sum preconstruction services and fee percentages for construction services.\n\t \nBased on the combination of points awarded and fee proposal, KITCHELL CEM INC. was determined to be the successful firm by providing the “best value” to the District.  Their proposal includes a fixed fee for preconstruction services [including design support, subcontract bidding and Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) development] of $168,888 and construction service fees and percentages to be applied to the Guaranteed Maximum Price.  The GMP and Site & Facilities Lease will be brought to the Board for approval once complete per conventional Lease/Leaseback contracting.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve an Agreement with KITCHELL CEM INC. for preconstruction services in the amount of $168,888 and construction service fees and percentages to be applied to the Guaranteed Maximum Price for the Theater & Vocational Technology Project at SJCC. \n",
