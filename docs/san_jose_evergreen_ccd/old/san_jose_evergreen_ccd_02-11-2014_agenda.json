Plescia & Co. from $75,000 to $95,000 in order to cover a one-year time extension resulting in additional costs. This agreement was originally dated January 19, 2012, and was subsequently amended on January 19, 2013, extending the term of the agreement to January 18, 2014. This Board item amends the term of the agreement to January 17, 2015 and augments the current contract from $95,000 to $113,000 as a result of this one-year extension and additional work assigned.  This extended time related to the developer selection process including seeking/obtaining of additional information from the RFP's, review/evaluation of such additional information, and corresponding coordination with District staff (and District legal counsel), which resulted in additional time and cost.\n\t \nThe four primary reasons for the requested contract amendment are as follows:\nConsultants attended and participated in a total number of meetings that substantially exceeded the number of meetings called for in the Scope of Work. The majority of these additional meetings related to the District’s process for review, evaluation and analysis of the proposals submitted to the District, including preparation of District staff recommendations for review/consideration by the Board Land Sub-committee. \nThe Scope of Work (as amended on August 2, 2013) called for a total of nineteen (19) meetings for Tasks 1, 2 and 3. To date, A. Plescia & Co. and Gruen Gruen + Associates either individually or collectively have participated in twenty-seven (27) meetings and/or telephone conference calls related to the District’s review/evaluation of the proposals submitted in response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) issued on May 17, 2013.\nConsultants prepared additional review, evaluation and analysis of supplemental information requested by District of certain respondents to the RFP. This will require certain revisions to the draft proposal evaluation report previously submitted to the District in September 2013 that presents the consulting team’s analysis of the subject proposals. \nConsultants participated in an additional Board of Trustee Land Sub-committee (December 3, 2013) that not only required the additional time for consultants to participate in the subject meeting, but also required consultants to expend additional time associated with preparation and submittal of written information (agendas, analysis, etc.), resulting in follow-up with the Board Land Sub-committee directions from their December 3, 2013 meeting over the next few weeks. \nConsultants will attend and participate in meetings with the Board of Trustees in February 2014 (and/or March 2014) regarding the Board’s review/consideration of District staff recommendations for selection of private sector developer(s) for disposition and development of the subject property (two meetings).\nAs shown above, the work completed to date as requested/authorized by the District has required an additional adjustment to the budget and time involved in the Scope of Work. The recommendation is that the Board of Trustees approves this contract amendment to extend the term of the agreement to January 17, 2015 and augment the contract by $18,000. \n\t \n",

The Board also requested a legal review of some of the policies, including some of the wording utilized in the policies; and this review will take place at a future meeting with legal counsel present. \n\t \nIt was also determined at the January 28 meeting that the Board needed to review the current Board committees. President Lease reviewed four criteria for board committees as outlined in the governance policy on committees. He requested that Board Committee Chairs review their committees in view of these criteria and be prepared to discuss with all board members at a future board meeting.\n\t \nSince legal counsel has not had ample opportunity to do a review of the draft governance policies, it was decided that at the February 11 board meeting, the board would work on a comparison of the language contained in draft governance policies document and BP Chapter Two and also hold a discussion on board committees.
