Professor Ken Jardin, full-time ESL and French language faculty at Evergreen Valley College, is scheduled to attend the 6th AFLiCo conference on May 26-28, 2015 in Grenoble, France. The conference’s major foci are integrating recent evolutions in consolidating and strengthening the network of cognitive linguists in connection with contiguous fields.\n\t \nThe conference will link cognitive and linguistic topics while taking into account social and cultural contexts, to model or document the integration of social and cultural information into linguistic structures to examine how linguistic variety shapes social and cultural representations. \n\t \nEach of these areas is part of a common trend, bringing together social and cognitive science. The 6th AFLICO conference will be about the development of this trend in connection with the framework of Cognitive Linguistics. The topics for 2015 encourage pluridisciplinary work where the following issues are of special importance:\nCorpus linguistics, usage-based linguistics, cognitive linguistics: description, models and theories of social and cultural factors.\nUsage, norms, rules, regularity: interdisciplinary approaches\nVariations in meaning and meaning(s) of variation: impact of variation on the production of meaning\nCategorization and prototypes: social and linguistic categorization\nLanguage, culture and ideology: cognitive and cultural models\nCognitive mechanisms underlying the reception and production of indexical meaning\nCross-linguistic variation, intra-linguistic variation and language acquisition\nSocio-cognitive approaches to translation and translation teaching \nProfessor Jardin will receive $500 in Staff Development Funds to apply toward expenses incurred for this event.\n\t \n \n\t \n",

The 28-college Bay region will receive a total of $11,316,648. After a 5% set aside for administrative costs, 60% of the remaining funds will be distributed directly to colleges using a formula based on FTES. The remaining $4.3M (approximately 40% of the total allocation) will be utilized to build the capacity of colleges to collaboratively meet regional workforce development needs. $1.3M of this is being directly allocated in equal amounts to each of the colleges to support the work of aligning college CTE programs. $3M will be allocated to multi-college partnerships that commit to collaborative efforts to address regional workforce development needs. \n\t \nSan Jose City College’s total allocation of the 60% and 40% enhancement shares of this funding is: $232,999\n\t \nThe legislation requires that funds target labor markets where the number of job openings exceeds the supply of candidates from community colleges and from other education and training providers. It also requires that funds be utilized to facilitate alignment of CTE programs across multiple colleges to better serve regional scale industries and labor markets. \n\t \nSan Jose City College will invest its share of the 60% Enhancement Funds in the amount of $186,570 in the following program areas:\nApprenticeship-Ironworkers\nMachine Technologies Advanced Manufacturing\nPrecision Instrument and Equipment Repair Technician\nApprenticeship-Carpenter/Construction Management\n\t \nThese are one-time funds that must be fully spent by March of 2016. \nSan Jose City College will receive an additional allocation of $46,429 from the 40% Enhancement grant by participating in a multi-college collaboration for an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Lab.\n",

This order includes 86 UPSs, external backup batteries, network cards for monitoring and rack mounting kits. The attached quote has the lowest cost found and is based on the only active piggyback bid found to enable us to order these UPSs in time for installation this summer. Transource Computers is the vendor and they are located in Phoenix Arizona. Although the Board has encouraged the district community to refrain from doing business with the State of Arizona, we think that it is in the Districtâs best interest to approve this business transaction because of the financial savings and short timeline to complete this project before students return in the fall.   \n\t \nPer California Public Contract Code Section 20652, \"the governing board of any community college district without advertising for bids, and when the board has determined it to be in the best interest of the district, may authorize by contract, lease, requisition or purchase order ...[to] purchase materials, supplies, equipment ... and other personal property for the district in the manner in which the public corporation or agency is authorized by law to make the lease or purchase.\" The contract must be based on the same prices and upon the same terms and conditions of a negotiated contract between the supplier and another public corporation agency. \n\t \nTherefore, when considering the best interest of the District, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees award a piggybackable  contract between NASPO ValuePoint Cooperative Purchasing Organization (formerly WSCA-NASPO) and Transource Computers without the need to further advertise on an already competitively bid contract. The NASPO ValuePoint Cooperative Purchasing Organization provides the highest standard of excellence in public cooperative contracting by leveraging the leadership and expertise of all states with the purchasing power of their public entities. Attached are an affidavit of publication, Master Price Agreement from NASPO ValuePoint Cooperative Purchasing Organization to Transource Computers that \"shall be effective upon approval by the Department of General Services\" dated September 15, 2010, Master Price Agreement Number B27177 Amendment Number 5, which extended the expiration date to September 30, 2015, and Quote #225606 from Transource Computers for $146,136.33.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
