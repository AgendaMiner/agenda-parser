Upon further inspection it was determined the corrosion to the boiler was beyond repair and required immediate replacement.  To temporarily remedy the problem of the District Office running cold, portable space heaters were distributed by the Maintenance Department throughout the District Office. This action resulted in overloaded circuit breakers. Because of this situation, the District did not seek formal bids as installation of a new boiler would be severely delayed and expose staff and the District to dangers of life and property. \n\t \nAttached are multiple bids that were requested informally from various vendors. The District invoked California Public Contract Code Section 20654, which states that “In an emergency when any repairs, alterations, work or improvements is necessary to any facility of the college, or to permit the continuance of existing college classes, or to avoid danger to life or property, the board may by unanimous vote, with the approval of the county superintendent of schools… make a contract in writing or otherwise on behalf of the district for the performance of labor and furnishing of materials or supplies for the purpose without advertising for or inviting bids.”  The District received approval from Dr. Charles Weis, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools.\n\t \nTherefore, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees unanimously approve and award the contract to Thermal Mechanical, Inc. in the amount of $42,876.00 for the emergency replacement of the District Office boiler system “without advertising for or inviting bids” “to avoid the danger of life or property.”\n\t \n",

Dr. Griffin provided a demographic report of each trustee area. He reviewed the 1 Person 1 Vote Rule, principles of the Voting Rights Act and those portions of the Education Code requiring that all school districts redraw their trustee areas after the federal census. Dr. Griffin also introduced the principle of 1% variance among contiguous trustee areas.  In other words, that we draw district boundaries that distribute the population in our service area within 1% of the ideal population.\n Since that first presentation the Board of Trustees has reviewed several presentations that: \nReviewed principles established by the Board of Trustees during the last redistricting effort in 2001 and integrate these same principles in the proposed options to be brought back to the Board (the overarching concern here is not to disadvantage minority communities and to support the election of a diverse board).\nIncluded GPS maps of proposed options that include major traffic arteries to make it easier to determine when a trustee area begins and ends and to compare and contrast with the current boundaries.\nPresented clear timelines between the next presentation (first formal public hearing) and the end of the process.\nDiscussed the implementation of outreach efforts to inform district constituents (voters) of the process underway at SJECCD including opportunities for public input.\nConducted a public hearing and received public input.\nResulted in further adjustments to the preferred redistricting option boundaries.\nThis item presents an overview of the top three most viable options resulting from the review conducted thus far.  In addition this time proposes a recommended option for final board adoption that responds to the concerns raised during the December 13, 2011 public hearing session on the topic.  This option complies with all of the six principles established by the Board of Trustees, and responds to public hearing input by addressing the following: \n1.  Maximizing cohesiveness of school district boundaries\n2.  Producing trustee boundaries that are more closely aligned with the current boundary lines\n3.  Maximizing majority/minority voting areas\n4.  Protecting continuity of community of interest groupings\n\t \nNote:  All information referenced above may be accessed on the San Jose/Evergreen Community College District Website through the following link:\n http://www.sjeccd.edu/aboutus/board/Pages/Redistrict.aspx\n\t \n Attachments\nRedistricting Trustee Area Boundary Adjustment SJECCD  January 10, 2012 Presentation\nPlan 5 (Modified Nakamura Plan 4 and Recommended Option)\n",

In summer 2010, Chancellor Cepeda issued a new directive regarding the “fee deferral promise” to both colleges which include the following:  \nWe would honor the “promise” made to students the previous academic years (i.e. 2007/2008 -2009/2010).\nBeginning with fall 2010, all AB540 students would be informed of their responsibility to pay enrollment fees.\nThe colleges were charged with the identification of student support strategies to continue to support these students (i.e. payment plans, identification of applicable private funds, book loans etc.)\nEstablishment of a district wide planning and coordinating team to address the fiscal liability incurred to date: namely, strategies for raising the necessary private funds to cover costs. \nIn this presentation, Chancellor Cepeda will address the district impact associated with the former ‘fee deferral promise,” AB540 fee liability in contrast to the overall receivable debt, current fundraising efforts to make good on the “fee deferral promise” and new state legislation which will ease financial hardship for AB540 students. \n\t \n",
