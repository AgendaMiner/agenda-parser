During the investigation and effort to repair the failure, serious issues of age and lack of maintenance were identified throughout the system.  An engineering firm was contracted to assess the system.  Based on its report a project was developed to replace the entire primary system cabling and address the numerous maintenance issues found.\n\t \nUsing this documentation District Purchasing issued a Request for Bids, requesting proposals for the Evergreen Valley College 21kV Electrical Upgrade Project. Bids were opened on September 27, 2012 and based on the evaluation of the bid prices and required documentation, Radiant Electric, Inc. was the lowest apparent and responsible bidder to provide the electrical contracting services.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve issuance of a contract to Radiant Electric, Inc. in the amount of $ 1,585,000 for the Evergreen Valley College 21kV Electrical Upgrade Project.\n\t \n\t \nContract Revisions and Changes \nNone\n\t \n\t \nBond List Revisions \nNone\n",
