At the November 12, 2013, board meeting, the Board of Trustees approved the creation of the Vice Chancellor, Information Technology (CISO) position. Although the district has not yet hired an individual for the position, it is important to add this position to our updated code. On November, 26, 2013, the district hired a Director of Facilities and Bond Program; and this position is a required filer. The district has also eliminated the Director of Bookstore Operations, Director of Employee Services (now the Director of Human Resources), and Director of Information Technology (now the Vice Chancellor, Information Technology.) Because of these changes, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the revised Conflict of Interest Code. A redlined and clean copy version is attached to this agenda item for the review of the Board. After the Board approves the revised code, it will be forwarded to the Santa Clara County Office to be approved by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.\n",
