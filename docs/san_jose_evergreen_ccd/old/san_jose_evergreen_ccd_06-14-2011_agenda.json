Her major responsibilities include managing five academic deans and overseeing the 40 programs and certificates that are offered to the 12,000 diverse students enrolled in Evergreen Valley College. During her tenure, Vice President Hay's major accomplishments include leading the college through the accreditation process, project management for new building development, facilitating multiple partnerships with K-12 partners, and fostering the development of new innovative career technical education programs.

The bill was granted reconsideration and was brought back up on Thursday and gained support from seven more members to bring the vote total to 42, sufficient for passage. The fact that the bill was nearly defeated after passing out of Assembly Appropriations with only one “no” vote, is indicative of significant opposition. The bill will now go to the Senate, where there will likely be additional amendments.  \n\t \nIt is recommended that SJECCD take an official vote not to support AB 515.  A resolution listing the rationale for this action is attached to this document.  It is important to note that districts already have the ability to offer “fee based” continuing education courses that would address some of the “capacity” concerns associated with budget related course reductions.  Finally, the major philosophical concern with AB 515 is the fact that it would represent the first step in the official “disinvestment” in state supported instruction in community colleges that represent the last vestige of open access for Californians.\n",

The budget for each project is an estimate based on current costs and escalation factors.  However, the final costs of each project may be affected by factors beyond the Districtâs control. Projects identified within the FMPs, but that are not funded by Measure G-2010 and require additional resources, are also represented for information purposes only.\n\t \nIn addition to estimating the soft costs (design, program management, specialty consultants, etc.) and construction costs for each project, every project has a 5% Project Contingency budgeted.  Each program also has a Program Contingency based on 5% of total estimated construction costs budgeted as a separate project. The District will carry a \"Catastrophic Contingency\" valued at 3% of the District-wide Bond Program.  These contingencies protect the integrity of the individual project budgets and programs, as well as the General Fund of the District, in the event there are excessive project costs.\n\t \nOnce the Board approves the Measure G-2010 Initial Master Project List, each of the Colleges' Program Management Teams will work with the colleges to refine and revise, as needed, the list of projects, the scope of each project, and to validate each project budget.  If project budgets require revisions or if the Colleges' project priorities are revised over time, revisions to this list will be brought back to the Board of Trustees for approval before any changes will be implemented.  Deferred Maintenance, Technology and Equipment Projects, as well as Administrative Costs are also captured within the Initial Project List.  The approval of the Initial Master Project List will drive detailed scheduling exercises at the District and Colleges that will guide the timing and size of the initial bond sale.  It is estimated that the first bond sale will occur in December 2011.\n\t \nAn Allocation Summary is also attached which illustrates Measure I, Measure G-2004, Measure G-2010 and State Capital Outlay resource allocations by entity.\n",
