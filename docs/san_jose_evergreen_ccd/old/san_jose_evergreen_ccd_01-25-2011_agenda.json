The board was not able to meet the requirements for evaluation in 2009 and 2010.\n2. The recent visit of the Accrediting Commission yielded six \"joint recommendations\" included in the reports for both Evergreen Valley and San Jose City College.  Five of these joint recommendations focus on Board Governance.\n3. The selection of a new Chancellor at the beginning of the 2010/2011 Academic Year will not permit a retrospective evaluation but will allow for prospective board direction on District Strategic Directions.\n\t \nGiven these factors the Chancellor should work as a staff resource with a Board Committee to establish a process that is consonant with accepted practice (California Community College Trustees/CCCT or the  Association of Community College Trustees/ACCT).  This process should include the means to assess and evaluate the following:\n\t \n1.  Responses to Accreditation recommendations on \"governance\"\n2.  Board operations and Board Effectiveness (BP 2745)\n3.  Approval of Chancellor's Proposed District Strategic Directions\n\t \nThe Board Committee should report to the Board on the specific process and procedures for evaluation by March 8 and present a report that summarizes the results and identifies actions that the Board may take as a result of the evaluation at its meeting of March 22.\n",
