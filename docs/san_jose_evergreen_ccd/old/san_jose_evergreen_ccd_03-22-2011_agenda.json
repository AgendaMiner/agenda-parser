K. Kellogg Foundation.  \n  \nThis MOU continues the partnership for an additional five years.  The program will now be referred to as the College Connection Academy (CCA).  Partners are committed to effectively deal with the achievement gap and offer students and their families the very best opportunity to have access to the academic preparation needed for a college education and a professional career.  The CCA is specifically designed to enable young people underrepresented (low income, first generation college goers, English language learners, students of color) to simultaneously earn a high school diploma and work towards a college degree.\n\t \nThe CCA model includes aspects of ECHS, the 7-12 model and the SQA skills for work. It also stresses personal responsibility and service. Students receive:\n Academic preparation for university work (including 1 year of college credit in grade 12) \nExposure to skills for work (career education) and internships\nA sound foundation in leadership and civic engagement\nCollege Connection Academy (CCA) will operate as a small focused school of choice within a school located on the Yerba Buena High School campus; policy and overall program oversight will be through the Steering Committee; daily operation and student responsibility is at the (YBHS) site level.\n\t \n\t The term of this agreement shall be effective August 10, 2010 through June 30, 2015.  Evergreen Valley College will act as the fiscal agent for the partnership.\n",
