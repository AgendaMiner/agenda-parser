Alignment of the work efforts we undertake are critical for resource efficiency in order to maximize opportunities for supporting student success.   \n\t \nBased on the work of the Board Legislative Committee, which included a review and analysis of legislative bills as well as related communication and meetings with legislators, staffers, students, and district bill-content experts, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the recommended bills for the 2014 legislative session with priority given to Tier One (Attachment A_1) bills and secondary consideration to Tier Two (Attachment A_2) bills.  \n\t \nThe third attached document (Attachment B_2014 Bills info only) are those remaining bills for consideration in the 2014 legislative session that are provided for informational purposes only because they impact our Community College system or because they address a population of K-12 students who will likely matriculate to SJECCD. \n\t \n",

In keeping with the District's desire to promote accountability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, the District went through a formal Request for Qualifications process to seek the services of a Program and Construction Management firm to provide system-wide coordination and oversight of all capital improvement work performed under the Measure G-2010 bond program.  Gilbane Building Company was selected through this process.\n\t \nSince the initial one-year contract with Gilbane awarded by the Board on May 10, 2011, policies and procedures for operating under the Bond have been implemented, overall program and detailed project scheduling has been established and maintained, accounting and purchasing procedures have been put in place and numerous projects have commenced design and are going into construction on the campuses and for the District.
