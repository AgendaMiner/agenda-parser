A similar message was voiced by President Obama in the State of the Union address on January 25, 2011.  This upward trend calls for a trained workforce that can be effective not only at the national level, but also globally. Evergreen Valley College would be able to reflect the interest the federal government has in establishing new partnerships in advancing the economic, political, and social well-being of U.S.A. here and abroad. \n\t \nStaff Attending: Liz Tyrrell, International Program Director; Hue Le, Counselor; Nasreen Rahim, Faculty; Lena Tran, Dean of Business and Workforce.\n\t \nProposed dates out of country activities (October 16 Departure to November 7 Return): Cities visited will include: \nGroup I: 10/17 Tokyo, 10/22 Singapore, 10/25 Cambodia, and 10/27 to 10/31 Saigon and Da Nang.  \nGroup II: 10/22 Singapore, 10/25 Bangkok, 10/27 Vietnam, 11/1 Bangladesh, 11/4 India and return 11/7.   \n\t \nPresentations will include Ministry of Education, high level officials, educational agencies, parents, and students.  Partnerships development and recruitment initiatives will include: agent expos, education briefings, school visits, and student events.\n\t \nPartnership development with universities, colleges and other educational providers, including recruitment and fair participation are the best opportunities for EVC to achieve greater visibility and creditability.   As the college is entering the international educational market, we will develop strategic partnerships with educational institutions and educational organizations. Evergreen Valley College has been selected to participate in Asia recruitment events and partnership engagements offered through American International Recruitment Council (AIRC) and Vietnam Education & Training Center (VETEC) due to the high demand in Asia to study in the United States.  VETEC is a reputable agency in providing recruitment events such as visits to local schools, college student fairs and agent workshops.  Tokyo and Singapore are the education hubs in Asia, AIRC is a trustworthy non-profit organization that provides guidance and best practices for partnerships development among colleges, universities, and agencies.\n\t \nSince Evergreen Valley College is located in Silicon Valley/Bay Area, our region is well-known worldwide contributing to the collegeâs branding overseas.  Our international branding and meetings with educational institutions and organizations will serve as a gateway for many students to start or complete their educational goals at EVC.  Additionally, having international students be a vibrant part of our campus provides domestic students with an opportunity to study and interact with other students from around the world. The cultural enrichment that occurs through having international students broadens the kind of education that enables students to achieve a better understanding of the world around them and encourages them to more fully participate in it.\n\t \n",
