The District recognizes the importance of supplier diversity and by creating sound business relationships, seeks to strengthen the economic development and viability for minority/women businesses. Through value-added strategic initiatives, the District expects increased competition and additional opportunities. The Minority-Owned, Women-Owned and Small Business Program will institute a variety of initiatives to identify and encourage small and disadvantaged businesses to participate in the District's procurement/bidding process in an effort to ensure continued growth of business opportunities for those business enterprises.\n \nThis program performs a key role by providing outreach, training, and educational programs. The Minority-Owned, Women-Owned and Small Business Program forms a connecting link between the District and the local small business community. Highlights of the plan include 1) community outreach and education, 2)  partnering with appropriate groups, 3) one-on-ones with small and disadvantaged firms, 4) targeted advertising, and 5) business seminars that teach small business owners how to participate in the public procurement process.  Skills obtained by small businesses through this program can also be used to compete for contracts outside of the Measure G-2010 program.\n\t \nThis service will be provided to the District by Gilbane at no additional cost to the District.  Sunnie Singh, an Evergreen resident and newest member of the SJECCD and Gilbane team, will be the program coordinator.  Attached please find the complete details of the program for your review.            \n\t \n       \n  \n\t \n   \n\t \n",
