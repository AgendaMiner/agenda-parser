Following the presentation, then Board President Ron Lind committed the board to the identification of specific actions needed to address and remedy the Commission findings. He went further indicating that a specific workplan, dates and targets for corrective actions would be developed and implemented. As promised, since that time, the Board of Trustees has developed a workplan, prioritized activities, conducted a 360 Board Evaluation process and on February 12, 2013, formally established an ongoing  Board Training and Development Schedule.  One of the training topics was identified as  \"Board Governance: Training and Exploration of the Carver Policy Governance Model.\"\n\t \nOn Saturday, August 24, 2013, the Board of Trustees held a Special Governing Board Meeting in which they received training on the Carver Policy Governance Model.

The design firm of Meyer+Silberberg (M+S) was selected through a competitive process to perform this work.  Their assessment included a review of the following elements: accessibility, paving condition and traffic flow, tree/plant/soil health, irrigation, exterior wayfinding and exterior lighting. This documentation provided detailed data into the issues the campus faces and steered prioritization by the College of improvements to be addressed. The final step was a conceptual design to support a long term plan for the campus landscape that is accessible, welcoming, and sustainable, with the goal of creating beautiful outdoor spaces for study and socializing.  \n\t \nA number of projects resulted from the assessment made at EVC.  One of the College’s priority projects is to make improvements to the general landscape (grounds and trees), its irrigation systems, and to address non-compliant ADA access.  (This project has a construction value of approximately $1 million.)  While it is normal to take competitive proposals for individual project RFQ’s, the work of this scope is very complex and dependent on detailed knowledge of the existing conditions at EVC.  Meyer + Silberberg, by virtue of having done the initial assessment, has that detailed knowledge.  Other firms that would be asked to propose would require additional staff time to review the assessment report and investigate the existing conditions, causing their costs to be higher and affecting the speed of project delivery.  For this reason, M+S was asked to submit a total-cost proposal for design services.  The initial proposal received was $175,000.  In thoroughly evaluating the scope and pricing, and in negotiation with M+S, a concise and appropriate scope of work was established at a reasonable cost for the design effort of $142,300.  As the scope will require numerous tasks that will tie into existing conditions, this reduction in fee allowed the College to include an allowance for unanticipated conditions of $40,000 should be included.  (This allowance is only used at the direction of the District.)\n\t \nIn total, the recommendation is to award a PAA for Design and Construction Phase Services as an extension of Meyer + Silberberg’s initial services for $182,300.\n",

In response the Chancellor prioritized the development of a statement on civility that would serve a dual purpose (1) respond to the board’s request; and, (2) comply with Accreditation Standard II.A.3.C which states that institutions of higher education must ensure the \n\t \n“Recognition of what it means to be an ethical human being and effective citizen:  qualities include an appreciation of ethical principles, civility and cultural interpersonal skills; respect for cultural diversity; historical and aesthetic sensitivity; and the willingness to assume civic, political, and social responsibilities locally, nationally and globally (Standard II.A.3.C.)”\n\t \n A workplan was developed including some of the following key developmental and awareness activities: \n\t \nFormation of the Civility Task Force – a districtwide invitation to serve was sent out and a significant number of individuals agreed to serve.  District Council members were also invited to serve. The Civility Task Force met on 11.7.2012; 12.5.2012; 2.6.2013; 3.6.2013; 4.10.2013; 5.1.2013; and 8.7.2013.  Agenda and meeting notes can be viewed at the following link:  http://www.sjeccd.edu/aboutus/chancellor/Pages/Chancellor.aspx   \nDistrict Council consultation and review -   Drafts of the Civility Statement were shared and reviewed in several District Council meetings on:  12.20.2012; 2.21.2013; 3.21.2013; and 4.18.2013.\nProfessional Development Day (PDD) Presentations –presentations designed to increase awareness and describe the work of the Civility Task Force were made at both colleges on the following dates:\nJanuary 25, 2013 - conducted a PPT \nApril 12, 2013 - including dissemination of draft statement\nAugust 29, 2013 - including the beginning of an awareness campaign in conjunction with the college presidents including the dissemination wristlets imprinted with the words “Civility.Worth.Dignity,\" and the introduction of a slogan  or brand for the District as follows:  “Civility begins with me! Everyone has Worth and Dignity.”  \nAttached is the final draft of the Civility Statement presented for first reading with expected action at the next meeting of the board scheduled for October 8, 2013.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t \n\t \n",
