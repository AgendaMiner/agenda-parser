State funding consists of community college Proposition 98 funds. These State funds are used as a match to pass through federal Title IV (e) funds, by way of an interagency agreement with the California Department of Social Services.\n\t \nCollege Responsibilities:\nEVC provides specialized and advanced training designed to teach knowledge and skills for kinship and relative caregivers:  EVC recruits facilitators to teach the workshops, schedules child care, invites foster parents to the workshops and reserves classrooms with county social services.\n\t \nTERM\nThis MOU is effective February 21, 2011 between SSA and EVC and shall remain in effect until June 30, 2011, unless terminated earlier or otherwise amended.

On May 2nd, we learned from our Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services that bond funds could be used to complete needed repairs to the building.  Therefore, we have not included the cost for repairs in the estimated shortages below:\n\t \nGeneral fund backfill that has been and will be needed to cover CDC budget:\n\t \n2009-2010:         $159,195\n2010-2011*:        $210,710\n2011-2012*:        $282,676\n*estimated\n\t \nAlthough some alternative strategies have been identified to reduce the current budget gap, coverage of the anticipated shortfall is still uncertain; therefore, due to the budget shortfall we are facing, the President recommends closing the facility.\n\t \nTherefore, the Chancellor recommends that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution No. 051011-2, Eliminate Positions and Layoff Classified Employees; and authorize District representatives to provide all affected employees with forty-five (45) day notices of layoff.\n\t \nIdentified are (11) positions to eliminate, (11) employees who are to be laid off, and (1) employee who may be bumped due to exercising of seniority rights.\n",

A survey methodology was recommended for the proposed work; and, in addition, the committee proposed strengthening the process by including a representative sample of district-wide internal constituents as well as members of the external community.  It is important to note, that BP 2745 does not require others outside the board to participate in the process, thus making this last recommendation unprecedented in nature.  The full board expressed consensus with the proposed methodology and established May 10 as a deadline for a report on the findings.\n \nThis item complies with the requirements established for the Board Self Evaluation Committee and includes a review of the methodology, analysis of the findings and conclusions formatted along recurrent themes.  In addition, the report presents a construct to compare and contrast the evaluation responses provided by board members and those provided by internal constituents.  The Committee will facilitate a public discussion based on the findings and will offer proposed \"next steps\" for consideration by the full board at a subsequent meeting.\n \nIt is expected that the Board Self Evaluation process will result in useful data to establish guidelines for the development of a work plan, including board development activities where necessary.  It is the express intent of the Board of the San Jose-Evergreen Community College District to use the outcomes of the self evaluation process not only to guide their future work but as clear evidence of intent to address accreditation concerns regarding role, function and the exercise of board leadership.\n  \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
