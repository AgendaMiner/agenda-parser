The document submitted made material changes to the Agreement, which required that the Agreement be sent to the State Chancellor’s office for review. However, the review was never requested.

District Counsel reviewed the protest and response by Premier Builders addressing the three issues. District Counsel and the Purchasing Department are in agreement that Premier Builders is the lowest qualified bidder, and should be awarded the contract, while the protest submitted by R.C.
