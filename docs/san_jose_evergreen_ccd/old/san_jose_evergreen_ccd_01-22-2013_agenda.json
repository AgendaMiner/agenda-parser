This item is now brought back to the Board for action. It is the staff’s recommendation that the Board approve this final draft.\n \nNationwide, the accountability movement has produced a number of definitions and measurements for student success. Invariably, these definitions and metrics focus on completion of degrees, certificates, and transfers. While these are legitimate measures, these do not adequately quantify or evaluate the transformational educational interventions provided by community colleges for community college students. What is needed is a more comprehensive definition of student success that refocuses the issue of student success as a process and not merely an outcome.\n\t \nIn the past few years, San Jose/Evergreen Community College District trustees and chancellor have participated in various efforts for defining and establishing policies for student success at national, state, and local levels through ACCT (Association of Community College Trustees,) CLASS (California Leadership Alliance for Student Success,) the State Legislature on SB-1456 and Student Success Task Force Recommendations, and the District’s participatory governance process including students, faculty and staff.  \n\t \nAt the December 13, 2011, Board of Trustee meeting, the Board acted to adopt a resolution for transmittal to the Board of Governors of the CCC urging them to delay their approval of the Student Success Task Force Recommendations to permit more time for system deliberation. In addition, the Board established a Board Subcommittee on Student Success. The Charge to the Subcommittee was to compare, contrast and analyze various source documents on student success and to present a set of policy constructs that would be consonant with the Board’s “Workplan and Strategic Directions.”  \n\t \nOn February 21, 2012, the Board Subcommittee on Student Success convened an introductory meeting with an expanded constituent group to explore the Committee’s purpose, role and function, guidelines and principles to guide the student success agenda, and definition of terms. Trustee Cruz was established as Chair. The Committee reviewed the CLASS document “Defining a Student Success Agenda.”  Under the leadership of Chancellor Cepeda, the constituent group was charged with a number of tasks.    \n\t \nThe Student Success Constituent Group composed of administrators, faculty, staff, and students (Attachment B) met on six different occasions between March 27 and December 20, 2012. Their work culminated in the development of a definition and proposed board policy on student success including metrics designed to measure policy implementation by the District (Attachment C). \n\t \nIn addition, it is important to note that task force members scheduled numerous presentations at college forums and at state and national conferences to share the findings and policy directions. All presentations were met with success, including responses from participant evaluations that reaffirmed the significance of the work.\n\t \n\t \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",
