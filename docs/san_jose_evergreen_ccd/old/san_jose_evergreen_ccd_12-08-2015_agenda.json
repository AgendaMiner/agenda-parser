Exchange of students;\n3. Accreditation of credits;\n4. Language training programs;\n5. Exchange of materials in education and research, publications, and academic information;\n6. Joint research and meetings for education and research;\n7. Other activities deemed appropriate.\n\t \nPartnership development with universities, colleges and other educational providers are the best opportunities for EVC to achieve greater visibility and creditability.   As the college is entering the international educational market, we will develop strategic partnerships with educational institutions and educational organizations such as UD.  Since its establishment, UD has been continuously developed its international collaboration so as to promote facility, staff capacity, student and staff exchange, curriculum, pedagogical method and content renovation, etc. Collaboration programs with international degrees awarded are increasing in number, facilitating access by many students in the Central Area and Western Highlands of Vietnam to advanced training programs in the world. \n\t \nUD is also one of the very first institutions in Vietnam that have engaged in the Vietnamâs training quality accreditation system and several disciplines have been recognized internationally. In order to integrate training and doing research, quickly develop post-graduate training scale as well as enhance the quality of scientific research, the university has recently created Teaching-Research Teams (TRT), built a number of research centers, modern laboratories through intensive and in-depth investment of the State. A number of projects involving research and technology transfer have been licensed with patents and applied in reality.\n\t \nUD is aiming to become a fully Research-Oriented University by 2020 and toward a Research University with its key roles as training highly qualified workforce and being a major center of research and international exchange. The construction projects of UD Village, University of Technical Education, University of IT and Communications, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, and especially VN-UK International University are underway, which will undoubtedly create a new face for UD. The synchronous development of facilities and highly qualified and capable staff will fuel the institutional achievement of the set strategy. \n\t \nSince EVC is located in Silicon Valley/Bay Area, our region is well-known worldwide contributing to the collegeâs branding overseas.  Our international branding and meetings with educational institutions and organizations will serve as a gateway for many students to start or complete their educational goals at EVC.  Additionally, having international students be a vibrant part of our campus provides domestic students with an opportunity to study and interact with other students from around the world. The cultural enrichment that occurs through having international students broadens the kind of education that enables students to achieve a better understanding of the world around them and encourages them to more fully participate in it.\n",

Measure G-2010 was passed by the voters on November 2, 2010, after which the Board of Trustees took action on December 14, 2010 to amend and restate the bylaws to allow for the existing committee to support both Measure G-2004 and Measure G-2010.\n\t \nThe Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) is required by statute to meet at least annually to review the District’s Measure G-2004/Measure G-2010 bond projects plan and to ensure that bond funds are being appropriately used as authorized by the voters.  There are no penalties defined in law for failure to convene a citizens’ oversight committee; however, the spirit of the law contemplates that districts will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the committee functions at least once each year to fulfill its statutory duties.  The current CBOC convenes quarterly for meetings.\n\t \nPursuant to Proposition 39, the Measure G-2004/Measure G-2010 Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee \nis required to have a minimum of seven (7) members comprised of one (1) student active in a community college support group, such as student government, two (2) Community-At-Large members, one (1) Senior Citizens’ Organization member, one (1) Business Community member and one (1) Support Organization member. It is requested that the following applicants be appointed for a second term to the Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee by the Board of Trustees. Members are allowed to serve three, two year consecutive terms.\n\t \nMember            Representing\nJohnny Lee        Community-At-Large\nLeo Cortez         Support Organization\n",

The request received from a member of the public is stated below: \n\t \n\"The administration has not been providing district email addresses for Citizen Bond Oversight Committee members. See communications below. Currently, the district has a web form message page for which the Chair of the CBOC is to look at incoming messages then distribute to the appropriate members. Allowing the Chair to see direct communications between a citizen and another committee member would be a clear violation of the Brown Act.\n\t \nProviding district email address to CBOC members does not require the members to use their assigned email address. Rather, each member can individually choose whether they want to utilize the service and/or communicate with the public.\"\n\t \nThe Chancellor's Office has earlier reviewed a similar request from the same individual. The response by the Chancellor to that earlier message stated that the District website does provide for your direct communication to the CBOC. The Chair of the CBOC directly receives messages sent through the CBOC email address. The alias is set up to inform him/her that a message had been received and the message is promptly forwarded to that person.\n\t \nState law provides for the establishment of the CBOC. The law does not provide that members of the CBOC engage with the public on a personal or private level. They are appointed members and their duties are expressly set forth in the code. Their meetings are public and actions are taken as a committee. The District does not have the authority to give out private email addresses. Members of the committee may be contacted through the established CBOC website link. Further, the statement that \"It is important that the communications between myself and an individual CBOC member not be reviewed or read by SJECCD staff or other CBOC members (Brown Act issues, etc.)\" is not correct.\n",
