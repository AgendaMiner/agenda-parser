Based on this discussion the committee agreed to focus the self evaluation in two areas:  (1) Board Operations/Effectiveness (2) Accreditation Findings.\n\t \nMethodology\nThe committee reviewed a draft survey instrument derived from a list of validated questions developed for Trustee use by the Community College League for California (see attached).  All items in the survey have been tested and validated.  In addition, the survey is constructed to permit analysis at two levels (1) Governance and, (2) Compliance with Accreditation Standards.\n\t \nExpanded Cohort\nBy definition, the process of self evaluation by Community College Board of Trustees is just that—evaluation of performance conducted by board members about themselves. It is not required that others evaluate the board.  Nevertheless, the committee recommends the participation of an expanded list of participants to be included in the evaluation of the board as follows:\n\t \n\t \nInternal\nExternal*\nBoard Members\nDistrict’s Executive Team\nDistrict’s Shared Governance Council\nCollege Shared Governance Councils\nLabor Representatives ( FA, CSEA, MSC)\nStudent Leadership Groups (EVC and SJCC Associated Student Government)\n\t\t\t\t\t \nCity Council\nCity Managers\nSan Jose Unified School District Superintendent\nMilpitas Unified School District Superintendent\nSanta Clara County Superintendent of Schools\nMayors ( San Jose/Milpitas)\nLegislative Representatives\nCongressional Representatives\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n*A different and abbreviated version of the survey instrument will be used with external constituents.  \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\t \n  \nTimeline\nBecause of the expanded nature of the proposed survey process the committee recommends to extend the timeline for completion from March 22 to May 10.  The findings of the survey will be discussed in public session.  It is expected that this discussion will generate specific guidelines for the development of measurable outcomes designed to address those Board performance areas that need to be strengthened.\n\t \nSummary\nIt has been two years since the Board completed a self evaluation.  The proposed methodology and expanded inclusion of internal and external participants is designed to provide a more constructive, comprehensive and honest review of the board.  It is a courageous step that while not required by law or policy, has as its aim the board’s willingness to ask their constituents, internal and external, for their honest opinion in attempt to move forward in a transparent and responsive manner.  It is also the intent of the board to ensure a direct and targeted response to each of the “shared recommendations” included in the Accreditation Reports to ensure that those findings citing board performance are directly addressed.\n",
