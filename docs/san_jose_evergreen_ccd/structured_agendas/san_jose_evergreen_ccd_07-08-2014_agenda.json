Luster & Associates (LLA) and Enterprise Foundation, for consideration and a possible collaboration having LLA as the lead consultant to achieve the District’s 15% outreach goal. \n\t \nThe District’s contract with L. Luster & Associates will yield significant impact on the District’s outreach efforts, both for the bond capital expenditures and in our daily operational spending.  LLA has demonstrated experience in assisting public agencies and private customers, including Alameda County, the City and County of San Francisco, and Kaiser Hospital in Redwood City.   The Enterprise Foundation is a coalition of many local and ethnically diverse chambers of commerce with a proven track record in developing and training small businesses to successfully compete for and perform contract work.  The Enterprise Foundation brings extensive database systems for identifying and tracking qualified businesses, as well as strong connections to the local minority and small business community.  These two teams together will bring organization, breadth of knowledge, clear communication and continuing relationships to our outreach efforts; we will see tangible, measurable results in terms of contract awards and contractor performance.\n\t \nThe consulting services agreement includes the following components:\n\t \nMarket research (identification and data collection) about local businesses and their readiness to perform work\nMetrics development for measuring and evaluating our outreach efforts\nCommunity outreach to introduce SJECCD to the region, make our business opportunities known, and build relationships with local businesses\nCoaching, training, and preparation opportunities for local businesses, and\nProject progress and results reporting, and recommendations for continuing improvement of the outreach program\n\t \nEach of these outreach services components will be developed collaboratively with District and Gilbane staff, but implemented by the consultant team. \n  \nIt is recommended that the Board ratify the attached contract between L. Luster & Associates, the lead organization for this collaborative between LLA and Enterprise Foundation, and the District in an amount not to exceed $311,845. Funding source will be general fund dollars as bond dollars are not allowable for this contract work.  As stated in the RFQ/P via the following link http://www.sjeccd.edu/Bids/Pages/RFQ-G2010-0089-Contractor-Outreach-Consulting-SErvices.aspx, this is a “one year contract renewable at the District’s discretion for two optional extensions of one year each.”  The LLA team and staff will present periodic progress reports to the Board. \n",

The student equity plan focus is a perfect alignment with the Extended Opportunity Programs & Services (EOPS) mission to increase access, course completion (retention/persistence), and basic skills completion, degrees, certificates and transfer for all low-income students and special student populations.[1] The EOPS programs at Evergreen Valley College and San José City College provide direct services to the student population as mandated under Student Equity Plan.  Title 5 regulations (title 5, §54220(d)) specify that SJECCD must review and address the need of the following populations when looking at disproportionate impact in student equity plans: American Indians or Alaskan natives, Asians or Pacific Islanders, Blacks, Hispanics, Whites, men, women, and persons with disabilities.[2]  The governor’s 2014-15 Budget proposed to target $100 million of additional Student Success and Support Program (SSSP) funding to close achievement gaps in access and success in underrepresented student groups, as identified in local student equity plans.  SB 852 (Leno), language specifies that the Chancellor’s Office shall allocate funds to districts “in a manner that ensures districts with a greater proportion or number of students who are high-need, as determined by the Chancellor’s Office, receive greater resources to provide services to these students.” [3]  Because students with disabilities and socioeconomic disadvantages are among the most vulnerable members of the population served by California community colleges, they are particularly dependent upon the scope and quality of programs for inclusion that facilitate their ability to obtain education in the California community colleges. The proposed state May 2014 Revised Budget elimination by the Governor's Office of partial restoration to the Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) would dramatically impact the ability of these student service areas to address the increase needs of our student target community at SJECCD.\n\t \nIt is, therefore, recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No. 070814-2 to restore SJCC & EVC programs to the 2007-2008 budget level using the Student Equity funds.\n\t \n\t \n[1] California Community Colleges Student Equity Plan Fact Sheet; January 2014; http://extranet.cccco.edu/Divisions/StudentServices/StudentEquity.aspx\n[2] California Community Colleges Student Equity Plan Fact Sheet; January 2014; http://extranet.cccco.edu/Divisions/StudentServices/StudentEquity.aspx\n[3] California Community Colleges Student Equity Plan Fact Sheet; January 2014; http://extranet.cccco.edu/Divisions/StudentServices/StudentEquity.aspx\n\t \n",

Plesica & Co., Gruen Gruen + Associates, Eller & Associates and staff with the San Jose Evergreen Community College District (the âteamâ), have completed market research, real estate financial analysis, land use planning and policy review and obtained consensus from the Board of Trustees of the San Jose Evergreen Community District on guiding principles for the disposition and development of an approximately 27-acre site adjoining Evergreen Valley College identified as not needed for the operations of the College. The team conducted meetings with a sub-committee of the Board of Trustees formed in order to review alternative property disposition and entitlement approaches and to review and approve the solicitation materials and process. Meetings were also held with the full Board of Trustees, which approved the issuance of the Request for Proposals.  \n\t \nPre-proposal meetings were held with potential respondents. Four proposals were ultimately received. An initial report was prepared that described the proposed developments, business terms/conditions, present value of proposed ground rents, and advantages and disadvantages of each proposal. The team conducted discussions with the respondents and briefed the sub-committee on the evaluation of the proposals.\n\t \nAt the direction of the sub-committee, the team conducted meetings with the development teams regarding requested clarifying/additional information about their respective proposals. Based on the additional information, an updated proposal evaluation report was prepared and a meeting with the full Board of Trustees was held to present the results of the evaluation and to obtain policy direction from the Board.\n\t \nPURPOSE \n\t \nIn light of the policy direction, the purpose of the meeting on July 8, 2014 is to provide an overview of the process to date and to describe the anticipated next steps to carry out the objectives of the disposition and development initiative to accomplish the goals of the Board of Trustees, including generating revenue to advance the educational mission of the District. \n",
