This savings could alternatively support student success and preserve critical faculty and staff positions.\n\t \nOn October 27, 2009,  the Board of Trustees participated in a Facilities Study Session that focused on Sustainability, Update on Measure G, Facility Master Planning and Capital Construction Project Approval Processes.  \n\t \nIn the Spring of 2010, the firm of Tramutola LLC conducted a Revenue Measure Feasibility Survey to assess potential voter support for a bond measure to modernize educational facilities and a parcel tax measure to protect community colleges from state budget cuts and maintain critical educational programs. The driving force of the Feasibility Study was a public opinion survey conducted among 500 likely voters in March 2010.  Results of the Feasibility Study suggest that if packaged appropriately and assuming a quality independently funded campaign to educate and mobilize support among voters, a local General Obligation Bond measure has a good chance of passage on the November 2010 ballot. Given this positive evidence that SJECCD can be successful if it places a prudent, responsible GO Bond proposal before the voters in November, District consultants will present highlights of their study, an overview of the election process and timeline, and provide recommendations for moving forward. \n\t \nThe Educational Facilities Master Plans and the Revenue Measure Feasibility Study will form the basis upon which the district will decide on the pursuit of a General Obligation Bond for Capital Construction and support of educational facilities in an amount that is perishable under the legal provisions set by law.\n",
