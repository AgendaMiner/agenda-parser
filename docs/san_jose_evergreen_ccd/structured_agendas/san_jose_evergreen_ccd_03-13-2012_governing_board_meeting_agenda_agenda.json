The interest rate will be based on three month LIBOR plus 100 basis points and be due on the first day of each month. The District will pay a fixed swap rate of $4.239% and 1.00% to First Republic Bank with an all interest rate of 5.239%. The current estimate of cost of issuance is $750,000 to be included in the bond proceeds.  The estimated annual debt service is $2.49 million for fiscal year 2013/2022 and $5.51 million for years 2023 through 2044. This represents a 3.25% escalation from 2023/2044.  \n\t \nThe District is currently rated Aa1 by Moody’s and AA- by Standard and Poor’s. If the District’s general obligation bond rating is downgraded, there is a 25 basis point increase to the pricing spread for each level of downgrade below Aa2 and AA-. This penalty is reversed for each upgrade by a rating agency.  The District covenants to maintain a rating of no lower than A3 by Moody’s and A- by Standard and Poor’s.\n\t \nOnce approval is received from the Board of Trustees, the Finance Team will move into action immediately to lock down an interest rate. It will then take about 30-60 days to complete the legal paperwork commemorating the OPEB Bond restructuring. \n",
