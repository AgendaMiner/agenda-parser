The State Chancellor will preclude use of the term \"Educational Center.\"  Furthermore, accreditation standards mandate that a Center is a separately accredited institution. The joint-use facility is not projected to meet either the State Chancellor or accreditation standards criteria over the next decade or longer.\n\t \nSince construction of the new San Jose-Evergreen Community College Extension is underway, and classes are scheduled to begin in Fall, 2016, it is important for this new facility to have a functional name in place. The district could change the name of the facility in the future. For the purposes of accreditation, the facility must be assigned to one college. Current student enrollment preference, quantity of respective college course and section offerings, distance and time comparisons align the Milpitas community more closely with San Jose City College than to Evergreen Valley College. As the lead college, San Jose City College will be responsible for site management, student support services, and overall community relations. San Jose City College is in the process of incorporating the facility in its accreditation self-study.\n\t \nIt is, therefore, recommended that the Board of Trustees approve naming the new facility San Jose-Evergreen Community College Extension, a partnership with the Milpitas Unified School District and identify San Jose City College as lead college for operations for the Extension. This action will give direction for the site and building signage, accreditation self-studies and for public discussions. \n",
