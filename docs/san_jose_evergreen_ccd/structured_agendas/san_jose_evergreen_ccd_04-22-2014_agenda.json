The three-year pilot program is an interim measure designed for the limited purposes of addressing the ACCJC’s requirements until the issues addressed in the pilot program are negotiated between the District and the Union.  As part of this pilot program, it is agreed that no data derived from SLO assessments shall ever be used to evaluate faculty performance.

Mr. Randy Parent, legal counsel from Liebert Cassidy and Whitmore, had recommended that the policies, with the exception of ends policies, be changed to principles, and that Executive Limitations be changed to Executive Requirements. He also recommended a change in the order of the principles and eliminated some principles that were more administrative in nature and that were already contained in Board Policies Chapter Two. Although the Board accepted the recommendations of the Task Force, it was determined that further work needed to be done on the ends policies. Therefore, the Board Governance Task Force met, along with Chancellor Cepeda and executive administrative assistant Joy Pace, on April 15, 2014, to provide additional ends policies to the Board governance document.

Some of the most well-known initiatives include VISTA, AmericCorps and the Peace Corps to name a few.\n\t \nService learning combines community service with classroom instruction, focusing on critical, reflective thinking as well as personal and civic responsibility. Service learning programs involve students in activities that address local needs while developing their academic skills and commitment to their community. Service learning has a positive impact on student learning outcomes, civic engagement, and retention.\n\t \nBeginning in 1994, the American Association of Community Colleges promoted the value of service learning to the 1,200 associate degree-granting institutions in the U.S. According to three AACC national surveys, two-thirds of all community colleges offer service learning in their curricular programs.\n\t \nIn 1996 Evergreen Valley College and San Jose City College established Service Learning and Public Service Programs. Since that time, both colleges have maintained the core mission of the program while developing slightly different approaches regarding the organization and delivery of services.\n\t \nThis item focuses on concerns raised by the Service Learning Faculty Coordinator at Evergreen Valley College in a memorandum dated October 17, 2013, entitled: \"EVC ServLearn Program, a Safety and Liability Risk to Students and District.\" This memorandum was addressed to the Chancellor and copied to the Board of Trustees, the leadership at EVC and the Faculty Association.\n\t \nSubsequent Steps\n\t \nNovember 26, 2013 - Meeting between Chancellor and Faculty Coordinator to review the October 17 memorandum, seek clarification and determine the educational needs and risk factors associated with the continuation of the program in its current state.\n\t \nDecember 2, 2013 - Meeting between Chancellor and College President to request prompt action be taken given the risk factor raised regarding student safety and to ensure that issues associated with the successful operation of the program would be addressed.\n\t \nIt is important to note that at no time has there been a directive to \"end\" the program. The direction has been to review, rectify concerns and, most important of all, to ensure student safety. Whenever the element of risk is raised by a faculty or staff member, this act places the district/college \"on notice\" requiring prompt action.\n\t \nThis item is brought in response to public comments presented at the April 8, 2013, Governing Board Meeting. The report will inform the board on the current status of the program and the program evaluation currently in place to address program concerns. It is expected that corrective actions be identified and implemented within the framework of resources available to ensure effective program delivery.\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n                                                            \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n",
