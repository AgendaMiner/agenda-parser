(BHM) for construction of the Measure G-2010 project – EVC Interim Police Facility & G-2010 Offices.  This project provides a temporary location for SJECCD Police operations during the upcoming construction of the new Police station and establishes on-campus offices for the Measure G-2010 program/construction management team. \n\t \nConstruction contracts often times experience unforeseen conditions, coordination gaps and/or design changes that require an adjustment to the contract price and/or duration in the form of a Change Order.  BHM CONSTRUCTION, INC. submitted written pricing proposals for changes detailed in an attachment that include additional or deleted materials, equipment, labor, time extensions as applicable and the prescribed mark-ups.  The Architect, Program Manager and Inspector of Record subsequently reviewed the proposals to ensure the pricing reflects industry rates and recommend the approval of Change Order #1 in the amount of $15,490.\n\t \nRepair broken water line at Field Restroom               $1,678\nExisting underground utility information did not indicate a waterline underneath pavement in the accessway for construction activities.  When the waterline leaked, BHM uncovered a break at a corroded joint which may have been the cause of the break.\n\t \nRelocate 10” waterline                                                $12,543\nExisting underground utility information indicated a 10” waterline which in the Contract Documents, the Contractor was directed to tap into for the installation of the new fire hydrant line.  Upon tapping into the line it was discovered that the line had been abandoned but not documented.  In conjunction with additional documentation investigation of the congested area of underground utilities, BHM subsequently uncovered an active waterline to use, but needed a specially configured, “hot tapped” connection to allow the fire line to remain active during the installation.\n\t \nLCN Closers                                                               $940\nIt was determined that 2 doors needed closing hardware.\n\t \nCircuit Breakers at Fitness Portables                          $715\nUpon reconnecting power to the existing Fitness Portables after the switchgear was relocated closer to the Interim Police Station and G-2010 Offices, it was discovered that the original circuit breakers were undersized and should be upgraded as part of this project for a safe re-installation. \n\t \nNon-Removal of 6” waterline                                     \nThe existing 6” waterline servicing the LETC fire hydrant was upsized to 10” to accommodate the new Interim Police & G-2010 Office fire hydrant.  It was determined to be less disruptive to the site to abandon the existing 6” waterline in place so BHM issued a credit for the removal and disposal work that they no longer were required to perform.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve Change Order #1 to BHM CONSTRUCTION, INC. in the amount of $15,490 for the Interim Police Facility & G-2010 Offices project at EVC.\n",

A revision in the amount of $18,118 was approved by the Board on July 10, 2012 to add the design of a co-generation system to the scope of work and to align the contract amount with the increased estimate of construction per the original Agreement. The original Agreement also established the perimeters of the construction work as abutting the anticipated boundary for the future South Campus Development project.  \n\t \nAs part of their permit approval, the City of San Jose Fire Department has required the installation of a fire hydrant, a fire access road and a temporary “hammerhead” turn-around for fire trucks that could be removed once the permanent fire lane is extended to the South Campus Development. Subsequently AEDIS prepared construction documents that included these improvements and submitted them as part of the initial review by DSA.  \n\t \nAt this time the South Campus Development project has now completed Schematic Design, siting the new Math, Science and Social Science building farther away from the Central Plant than originally envisioned.  This more distant boundary now allows adjusting the limit of work for the Central Plant project enabling the “hammerhead” to be located more strategically in the field to the south end of the project.  In doing this, three mature trees will be saved, existing light poles can remain and less paving will be required.  The construction cost savings and saving of mature trees provides a greater benefit to the project than the cost of this revision to the AEDIS contract.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve PAA Revision #002 to AEDIS ARCHITECTS in the amount of $7,579 for the Central Plant and Police Station Renovation project at EVC.\n",

The goal of the session was to review model practices and standards for “effective trusteeship” with a special emphasis on the importance of speaking “with one voice.” The session reviewed guidelines about the governance role of the board as policy makers differentiated from the administrative and managerial role of the Chancellor in the implementation of board policy. Review sessions and discussion centered on six different areas as follows:\n\t \n• Board Vision/Mission/Goals\n• Effective Governance Processes: The Carver Governance Model\n• Current Board Structure: Committees and Task Forces\n• Board Self Evaluation and Workplan Development\n• Board Skills Development Program\n• Board Master Calendar\n\t \nThis item presents a “Summary Report” including  (1) a listing of proposed board development and training issues as well as internal and external opportunities to schedule this training; and, (2) A Master Calendar listing critical board topics and presentations to be scheduled in subsequent board meeting agendas.\n\t \n\t \n",
