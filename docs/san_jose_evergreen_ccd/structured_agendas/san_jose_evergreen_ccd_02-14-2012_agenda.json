This hot water is leaking into EVC’s tunnel, through some electrical/IT conduit and gradually getting worse. If this were to continue, not only will it waste water, the District will be unable to supply any heat to the Sequoia Building and Lecture Hall. The cause of this leak was due to poor or improper installation. To properly remedy this issue, we must abandon the existing pipe that is currently in place and install 120 feet of new pipe from the tunnel. Because of this situation, the District did not seek formal bids as the delay in installing 120 feet of new piping expose staff and the District to dangers of life and property.\n\t \nAlthough the District did not seek formal bids, the District did seek three informal bids. The District invoked California Public contract Code Section 20654, which states that “In an emergency when any repairs, alterations, work or improvements is necessary to any facility of the college, or to permit the continuance of existing college classes, or to avoid danger to life or property, the board may by unanimous vote, with the approval of the county superintendent of schools… make a contract in writing or otherwise on behalf of the district for the performance of labor and furnishing of materials or supplies for the purpose without advertising for or inviting bids.” The District received approval from Dr. Charles Weis, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools.\n\t \nTherefore, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees unanimously approve and award the contract to Thermal Mechanical, Inc. in the amount of $39,395.00 for the emergency upgrade of 120 feet of pipe that supplies heating water to the Sequoia Building and Lecture Hall at Evergreen Valley College \"without advertising for or inviting bids” “to avoid the danger of life or property.”\n",
