Fully implemented, this product will help with student learning outcomes (SLOs) and curriculum design, as well as provide support for scheduling and facilitation of catalog production.\n\t \nPlease note this contract includes purchase of Curricunet plus one-year of maintenance fees, total\n\t \n\t \ning $160,000.
