Any increase made pursuant to this section shall be effective upon approval by the governing board.

If the Board approves another 5% increase, it would increase the monthly compensation to $441, effective December 1, 2014.  All governing board members also receive an additional $100 monthly stipend to cover communications costs, such as mailings and cell phone monthly charges associated with district business. \n\t \nIf the Board approves this action, the monthly compensation for Student Trustees will be increased from $210 to $221 per BP 2725 which states that \"Student Trustees shall receive half of the compensation paid to board members.\"\n",
