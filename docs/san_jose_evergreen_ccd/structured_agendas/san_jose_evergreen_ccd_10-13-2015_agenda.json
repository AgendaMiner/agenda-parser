These changes are limited to the bid limits or to 10 percent of the original contract price whichever is greater. These limits, according to the California Attorney General, \"…appear to be inserted to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would, in effect, constitute the making of a new contract.\"[1] Furthermore, it is in the Attorney General’s view that “… change orders are appropriately contemplated where, during the performances of the contract, unforeseen matters are discovered which require some modification to complete the contract.” 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 417 (1990).\n\t \nThe purpose of Sections 20118.4 and 20659 is to allow some flexibility following the award of the bid, and to ensure that substantial changes are not made which would constitute the making of a new contract. In effect, the change order provisions allow districts to negotiate changes to a contract provided the contract is not materially altered by the change order to such an extent that it would create a new project or contract which should be bid separately.  Public bidding of the increased scope of Work would not have produced an advantage to the District, and would produce a net burden and distinct disadvantages to the District. Based on the foregoing, it would be incongruous, futile, and unavailing to publicly bid the increased scope of Work.  \n\t \nThis has undergone District legal counsel review for compliance with Public Contract Code.\n\t\t \n[1] 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen 417 (1990) footnote no. 3\n\t \n",

The project timeline is to deploy the network switches first in the new AutoTech building this fall, new Main Distribution Facility (MDF) in December-January, and the new South Campus buildings in fall/spring (per construction schedule). The remaining network installations will occur during spring and summer 2016 while the new fiber optics cabling is installed between the new MDF and current buildings. The project quote includes up to 40% of after-hours work so as to minimize disruptions to the classroom. The wireless network will be configured as the network switches are replaced, building by building, and as additional cabling is installed for the Wireless Access Points (WAPs). The goal is to largely complete this project (90%+) before fall 2016 classes begin - however this timeline is directly dependent upon getting the fiber optics cabling, WAP cabling and Building/Intermediate Distribution Facility (BDF/IDF) updates installed in a timely manner. \n\t \nThis project is a major deliverable of Bond Project #32702 to upgrade the IT and Technology Equipment at EVC.

With input from all seven participating districts, as well as approximately 30 community organizations, SBCAE developed a three year plan to address services gaps and to align and expand adult education services within the region.  This regionally supported plan was submitted to the state in March 2015 and subsequently accepted.\n\t \nIn June 2015, AB104 introduced an Adult Education Block Grant (AEBG) that outlines specific requirements that consortia must follow for the implementation of their local plan.  The SBCAE plan covers a range of activities that include curriculum alignment, assessments, bridge programs, transitional student support services, business collaboration partnerships, technology, data sharing/tracking and marketing. \n\t \nThis presentation provides up to date information on the AEBG implementation process, ongoing faculty and academic senate engagement in the program development and approval process, and a description of the six SJECCD Career Development and College Preparation (CDCP) programs that will improve adult learner transition into postsecondary education and workforce preparation proposed for the 2015-16 fiscal year.\n",
