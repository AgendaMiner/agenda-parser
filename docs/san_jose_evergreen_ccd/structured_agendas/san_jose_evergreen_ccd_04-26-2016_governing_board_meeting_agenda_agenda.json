This trip is in partnership with Merritt College’s African American Studies Department. The students will be accompanied by Merritt College faculty member Nehanda Imara.  The students will leave San Francisco on Sunday, May 29, 2016 and will be returning on Saturday, June 11, 2016. The estimated cost for travel is $10,200 ($3,400 per person).   \n\t \nThe purpose of this trip is to provide an opportunity to travel abroad to those who might not otherwise have such an opportunity.  This includes economically disadvantaged students, students of color, and students who are single parents in the San Jose Evergreen Community College District.  The primary objective is to globalize their understanding of a third world country historically, culturally, geographically, and economically. Prior to the trip, students will receive numerous lectures on world history, global economics and geography.  While on the study abroad tour students will receive numerous lectures and field study projects from University faculty. Students will also be required to register for 3-units of college coursework at Merritt College (i.e. AFRAM 3-Ghana: Pan African Thought and the Struggle for Africa’s Liberation) during the summer of 2016.  Evergreen Valley College’s AFFIRM Program has partnered with Merritt College’s African American Studies Department for the past three years on study abroad tours.  Evergreen will continue to use Merritt College’s study abroad model to develop its own study abroad program for future students.  No college funds are used. \n",
