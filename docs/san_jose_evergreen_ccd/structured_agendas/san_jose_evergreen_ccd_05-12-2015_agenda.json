(the “Underwriter”).  The Resolution authorizes the issuance of current interest bonds only.\n\t \n(b)        Form of Purchase Contract.  Pursuant to the Purchase Contract, the Underwriter will agree to buy the Refunding Bonds from the District.  All of the conditions of closing the transaction are set forth in this document, including the documentation to be provided at the closing by various parties.  Upon the pricing of the Refunding Bonds, the final execution copy of the Purchase Contract will be prepared following this form.\n\t \n(c)           Form of Preliminary Official Statement.  The Preliminary Official Statement (the “POS”) is the offering document describing the Refunding Bonds which may be distributed to prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds.  The POS discloses information with respect to, among other things, (i) the proposed uses of proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, (ii) the terms of the Refunding Bonds (interest rate, transfer terms, etc.), (iii) the bond insurance policy for the Refunding Bonds, if any, (iv) the security for repayment of the Refunding Bonds (the ad valorem property tax levy), (v) information with respect to the District’s tax base (upon which such ad valorem property taxes may be levied), (vi) District financial and operating data, (vii) continuing disclosure with respect to the Refunding Bonds and the District, and (viii) absence of litigation and other miscellaneous matters expected to be of interest to prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds.  Following the pricing of the Refunding Bonds, a final Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds will be prepared, substantially in the form of the POS.\n\t \n(d)          Form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate.  The form of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate can be found in APPENDIX C to the POS.  Effective July 3, 1995, all underwriters of municipal bonds, are obligated to procure from a bond issuer a covenant that such public agency will annually file “material financial information and operating data with respect to the District” through the web-based Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system maintained by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (which is the federal agency that regulates “broker-dealers,” including investment bank firms that underwrite municipal obligation issuance).  This requirement is expected to be satisfied by the filing of the District’s audited financial statements and other operating information about the District, in the same manner the District has filed in connection with prior bond issuances.  The purpose of the law is to provide investors in the Refunding Bonds with current information regarding the District.  Similar laws have governed the corporate debt market for many years. \n\t \n(e)          Escrow Agreement.  Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds in an amount sufficient to redeem the Refunded Bonds will be deposited in an escrow fund (the “Escrow Fund”) held by U.S. Bank National Association (acting as “Escrow Agent”).  The monies in the Escrow Fund will be used by the Escrow Agent to refund all or a portion of the Prior Bonds on the respective first available redemption dates following the closing of the Refunding Bonds (September 1, 2015 for the 2004 Series A Bonds, and September 1, 2018 for the 2004 Series B Bonds).  As a result of the deposit and application of funds so provided in the Escrow Agreement, the Refunded Bonds will be defeased and the obligation of Santa Clara County to levy ad valorem property taxes for payment of the Refunded Bonds will cease.\n\t \nFISCAL IMPACT\n\t \nThere is no fiscal impact to the General Fund resulting from the issuance of the Refunding Bonds.  \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION\n\t \nStaff recommends approval of Resolution No. 051215-3 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF THE SAN JOSE-EVERGREEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT (SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA) 2015 GENERAL OBLIGATION REFUNDING BONDS.\n",

In keeping with the District's desire to promote accountability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, the District went through a formal Request for Qualifications process to seek the services of a Program and Construction Management firm to provide system-wide coordination and oversight of all capital improvement work performed under the Measure G-2010 bond program.  Gilbane Building Company was selected through this process.\n\t \nSince the initial one-year contract with Gilbane awarded by the Board on May 10, 2011, policies and procedures for operating under the Bond have been implemented, overall program and detailed project scheduling has been established and maintained, accounting and purchasing procedures have been put in place and numerous projects have commenced design and are going into construction on the campuses and for the District. Each contract was for time and materials only at a not-to-exceed amount, with the fourth year (FY2014/15) value of $5,724,420.  The agreement has the option to renew annually through 2018.  The proposed contract amount for the fifth year (FY2015/16) is valued at $5,297,131.\n\t \nAs for the Measure G-2004 bond program, the FY2014/15 contract is $980,785 and the proposed FY2015/16 contract is $1,306,030.\n\t \nThe Board is being asked to review this information on May 12, 2015 and then take action on a year five (FY2015/16) contract renewal for the Measure G-2010 bond program and a contract for FY2015/16 for the Measure G-2004 bond program at the June 19, 2015 Board of Trustees meeting.\n",
