Compared to the previous two years, this budget has been reduced by nearly $50,000. This reduction is due to inaccurate budget reports provided in previous years where funds in reserves were included in the budget as income. \n\t \nAlthough the ASEVC are aware that further withdrawing funds from reserves is not a sound budgetary practice, they have decided to decrease the budget by $50,000 rather than drastically cutting it by half. This will permit the ASEVC to continue to fund programs that augment financial assistance to low-income EVC students at a reduced level. The plan is to gradually decrease the expenses this year so that it does not adversely affect students that have become dependent on programs such as the Book Voucher Program and Emergency Student Grant. The goal is to inform the EVC student body of changes to funding this year and to attain a balanced budget by the 2012-13 fiscal year.\n",
