The President's Volunteer Service Award is an initiative of the Corporation for the National and Community Service and is administered by the Point of Light Institute. Kordai Herring was recognized for his 5000 hours of volunteer service; Ramon Ramirez, for 4013.50 hours of volunteer service.\nBackground Information on the awards extracted from the Presidential Service Awards Website\nAmerica has a long and proud tradition of volunteer service. Now more than ever, volunteers are renewing their commitment to helping others and making new connections that bring us closer together as families, as neighbors, as communities, and as a Nation.\nThe President's Council on Service and Civic Participation (the Council) was established in 2003 to recognize the valuable contributions volunteers are making in our communities and encourage more people to serve. The Council created the President’s Volunteer Service Award program as a way to thank and honor Americans who, by their demonstrated commitment and example, inspire others to engage in volunteer service.\nRecognizing and honoring volunteers sets a standard for service, encourages a sustained commitment to civic participation, and inspires others to make service a central part of their lives. The President’s Volunteer Service Award recognizes individuals, families, and groups that have achieved a certain standard – measured by the number of hours of service over a 12-month period or cumulative hours earned over the course of a lifetime.\nTo date, the President’s Council has partnered with more than 80  Leadership Organizations and more than 28,000 Certifying Organizations to bestow more than 1.5 million awards to the Nation's deserving volunteers.\nFurther information can be found on the link below:\nhttp://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/tg/pvsainfo/dspAboutAwards.cfm\n",

In this analysis was factored the projected cost increases in the District budget with no anticipated increase in revenue, along with an assumption that the State will be delaying the General Apportionment payment for the month of June until July 2011. We anticipate projected deficit during the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal year 2010/2011.\n \nEach year, many community colleges project negative cash flows in some months and must engage in temporary borrowing in order to ensure that funds are available to meet payroll and other expenditures. Fortunately, for many years, the California Community College League has coordinated an effort to pool the cash needs of these districts by issuing one debt instrument for all districts. This provides substantial savings in the cost of going to market with short-term debt instruments. The cost of these Tax Revenue and Anticipation Notes (TRANS) will be roughly $320,000 - $350,000 to the District, most of which will be offset by the short-term investment earnings that the District will earn while this money is deposited in the County's investment pool. The estimated expense to the General Fund after netting out investment income from the cost of the TRANS will be approximately $100,000.\nAttachment A contains the resolution that the Board of Trustees must adopt in order for the District to participate in the pooled TRANS program.\n",
