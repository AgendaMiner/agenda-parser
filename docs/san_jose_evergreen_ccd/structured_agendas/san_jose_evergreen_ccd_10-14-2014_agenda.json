Some of the specific topics for review and discussion will include:\n\t \n•   Board Vision/Mission/Goals\n•   Effective Governance Processes: The Carver Governance Model\n•   Current Board Structure: Committees and Task Forces\n•   Board Self Evaluation and Workplan Development\n•   Board Skills Development Program\n•   Board Master Calendar\n\t \nMore than one year later and after thirteen more scheduled discussions, including weekend study sessions; the board of trustees finally approved a document on May 13, 2014, under the heading “San José-Evergreen Community College District, Board of Trustees Ends Policies and Governance Principles.”\n\t \n\t \nhttp://www.sjeccd.edu/Chancellor/Documents/SJECCD%20Board_Ends%20Policies_Governance%20Principles%205%2013%2014.pdf\n\t \n\t \n\t \nImplementation Step 1 : Lessons Learned from Ends to Means\n\t \nThe work of the Board has been described as transformational, but there has also been significant change in the work of staff.  Having clarity about the Board’s policy directives require the clear identification of strategies that staff must utilize and deploy to ensure implementation.  Furthermore, these strategies (i.e. means) must also be quantifiable in order to demonstrate accountability and progress. There are several principles or guideposts that emerged from board discussions on the matter of governance and policy development that we as staff have used to guide the development of our workplans.  Listed below are a few of these key precepts:\nA Board that does not prescribe ends has no target\nPrescribing ends is an absolute priority but prescribing means is not\nDescribing the target to be hit and what to avoid is governance; doing it is management.\nThe Board controls operational means by describing the parameters of what is unacceptable. These parameters include compliance with the following:\nLaw\nEthics\nFair Treatment of Employees\nPrudence/Diligence\nStaff work is both accountable and measurable\nIf we have staff that is afraid of failure, then we have staff that is mediocre\n\t \nImplementation Step 2 - Workplan Development\n\t \nThis report presents the work undertaken by Executive Staff designed to identify the “means strategies” that will enable the implementation of the “ends policies” as prescribed by the Board of Trustees. The Chancellor charged staff with the development of individual workplans and the identification of means strategies that would contribute, advance and “move the needle” toward the implementation of the Board’s “global ends policies.”   This task, while time consuming, turned yielded a series of unintended but welcomed organizational outcomes in several areas including:\nBoard Policy Alignment – Development of a crossover between Board’s Ends Policies and Board’s Strategic Priorities (see attachment A)\nStrategic Planning Alignment - Alignment of multiple strategic planning documents (i.e. Educational, Facilities, Technology, Human Resources, Budget and Research)\nInterdependence - Development of side-by-side workplan comparisons demonstrating the crossover and support provided from one division/staff person to another.  In other words, we have been able to identify areas in which the work in one college, administrative unit or department clearly supports and, in some instances, clearly depends on the work of another.\nGaps and Duplications – Workplan development and comparisons have also helped to identify gaps and eliminate duplication of effort.\nResource Allocation -  Alignment, focus and direction has increased staff’s ability to determine the most effective and efficient ways in which to allocate resources (fiscal, human, facilities etc.)\nChanging the \"Script\" – The consistent use of new terminology (i.e. ends, means) has resulted in the development of communications and work products that reflect and continuously re-enforce our focus and progress toward a single direction; namely, the implementation of the Board’s Global Ends Policies.\n\t \nThe  Chancellor Workplan\n\t \nIn reviewing the SJECCD Global Ends Statement Chancellor Workplan (See attachment B), the reader should take into account several considerations:\n\t \nFormat/Organization - The Workplan begins with a staff response to the board's \"Global End Statement\" and its six subcategories (Career Development, Transfer, College Readiness, Institutional Excellence, Student Success and the College Experience).  The matrix then aligns each of these areas with the 2013-2017 Strategic Priorities previously established by the board. The matrix concludes with a proposed \"metric\" designed to measure the impact that each of these efforts will have in each designated area.\n\t \nTargeted Emphasis - As expected, the Presidents' workplans are the most comprehensive, impacting all areas of the enterprise. It is for this reason that the presidents' work is listed first.   Vice Chancellors and other Executive Staff follow; and their workplans clearly target the area of \"Institutional Excellence,\" focusing greatly on the supportive work, infrastructure development and the attendant fiscal, human resources, reporting and legal structures that sustain the work of the colleges.\n\t \nTopics and Themes - It is gratifying to note that regardless of the area of focus nearly all of the strategies and metrics identified clearly focus on students and their success.\n\t \nFaculty and Staff Development - It is clear from the strategies identified that our District must increase its investment in the development of added and targeted expertise of faculty and staff.  As we undergo significant transformations in curriculum, technology, reporting process and expected outcomes and accountability; it is critical that we identify and provide the necessary training and upgrades to move in the right direction.\n\t \nConstructive Criticism - We are clearly still in a developmental process including a \"culture change\" regarding the way in which we view our work.  Some of our strategies still appear to be more like tasks than long range objectives, but this is to be expected given our need to ensure continuity of effort.\n\t \nInformed Decision Making – Ongoing analysis and reporting of data is expected to inform decisions to adjust, increase or rethink work at the individual and composite team level.\n\t \nNext Steps\n\t \nDevelopment of the Board's 2015 Agenda- The Executive Workplan will form the basis for the Board's Agenda items for the 2015 Calendar Year.  The Board's Revised Governance Process has three basic components (1) the development of Global Statements,(2) the establishment of \"Means Strategies/Workplan\" to implement the Board's mandate and (3) the development of an annual agenda that ensures ongoing reporting on the attainment of each objective.  This last component is achieved through the establishment of a year long agenda for the Board.  It is expected that a proposed draft agenda will be brought to the Board of Trustees at its next meeting (10/28/14) to prepare for final adoption before the election of new board officers in December.\n\t \n\t \n",
