Although much preparation is necessary for the success of this endeavor, the fiscal and environmental contributions make this a worthwhile task. The most recent yard sale took place on May 7 – 8, 2010, and resulted in over 27,000 lbs. of materials being diverted from landfill. The proceeds from the yard sale totaled over $9,700 that was contributed to the general fund.
