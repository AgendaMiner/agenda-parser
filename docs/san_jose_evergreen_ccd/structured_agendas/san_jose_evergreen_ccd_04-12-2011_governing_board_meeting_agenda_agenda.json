In preparation, the District engaged the California Community College League of California in a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") to assist with the solicitation and evaluation of solar proposals and the procurement process for solar proposals.  The League's Solar Electric Consulting Services Program provides professional and technical services, is free to the District and covers its costs by exacting a fee from any solar vendor from which the District purchases a solar electric system.  The League's consultant is Clyde Murley.\n\t \nIn anticipation of bond resources availability, in July 2010, the District applied for a reservation for a 849.319 kW system located at Evergreen Valley College, under the California Solar Initiative Program in cooperation with Pacific Gas & Electric (\"PGE\").  The District successfully reserved an incentive amount of $1,413,594.  The incentive payments will be made to the District on a monthly basis over a 5-year period following system installation, submission, and approval of incentive claim materials.  The incentive payments will be based on the per kWh incentive rate of $0.19 and on the actual energy produced in that time period.  The Proof of Project Milestone due date was March 18, 2011.  This contract with SunPower for $5,596,785 was submitted to PGE on that date, with the notice that the Board of Trustees would entertain the ratification on April 12, 2011.  Ratification by the Board of Trustees will ensure the reservation incentive remain in place.  Project completion is anticipated by January 20, 2012, which is the reservation expiration date.\n\t \nThe installation of the Solar Facilities is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to Sections 15301, 15303, 15311, and/or 15314 of Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3, Article 19 of the California Code of Regulations (“CEQA Guidelines”), which categorically exempt the addition of accessory structures to existing facilities, including when such additions neither increase original student capacity nor add additional classrooms. In accordance with Government Code Section 4217.12, the District gave public notice at least two weeks in advance of the public hearing held on April 12, 2011 on the District website and on BoardDocs; and earlier this evening the Board opened and completed the public hearing required pursuant to Government Code Section 4217.12.\n\t \nThe exact site location at Evergreen Valley College for the proposed solar array will be determined with input from the college.  Once ratified by the Board of Trustees, the project will proceed quickly to ensure that the incentive will be preserved and support energy cost relief to the general fund as soon as possible.  The attached financial analysis projects one time savings through receipt of the incentive rebate of $1,413,594 payable over five years, as well as ongoing electricity savings of an estimated $250,000 per year.  Total anticipated operational savings are $8,114,335 over the life of the array. Net cost is $2,417,550.  The savings analysis performed by the League consultant is attached.\n",

In keeping with the District’s desire to promote accountability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, the District was seeking the services of a Program/Construction Manager to provide system-wide coordination and oversight of all capital improvement work performed under the Measure G-2010 Program.

Research findings included the following:\n\t \n·       We have insufficient funds to cover all the costs associated with the CDC; the district has had to augment the budget by $150,000 to $300,000.  Future resources remain uncertain, and the outlook is grim for all California Community Colleges.\n·       The age and condition of the Center create a less than desirable environment for children and will require significant maintenance with no funding to cover the costs. \n·       The CDC is not ADA compliant, hallways are too narrow.\n·       During the Fall, 2010 semester, we received a citation indicating that the Center “could become a risk to the health, safety, or personal rights of children in care if not corrected.”\n\t \nTherefore, the President recommends closing the facility.  \n\t \nIt is important to note that we are committed to bringing back childcare services to San Jose City College and have begun building a plan for the future of the Center.  The centerpiece of this plan would be the construction of a new, safe, secure building as well as creating a self-support organization through innovative programming and partnerships with our community.\nTherefore, the Chancellor recommends that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution No. 041211-4, Eliminate Positions and Layoff Classified Employees; and authorize District representatives to provide all affected employees with forty-five (45) day notices of layoff.\n\t \nIdentified are (11) positions to eliminate, (11) employees who are to be laid off, and (1) employee who may be bumped due to exercising of seniority rights.\n",

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 and was amended in the School to Work Opportunities Act of 1994.\n\t\t \nTech Prep education is a 4+2, 3+2 or a 2+2 planned sequence of study in a technical field beginning as early as the ninth year of school. The sequence extends through two years of postsecondary occupational education or an apprenticeship program of at least two years following secondary instruction, and culminates in an associate degree or certificate.\n\t\t \nTech Prep is an important school-to-work transition strategy, helping all students make the connection between school and employment.\n\t\t \nInformation received from the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) in March indicates that the best projection it has for Tech Prep is that the program for 2011-2012 would be called CTE Transitions. CTE Transitions will focus on which postsecondary classes will most effectively help the college recruit and retain secondary students within their CTE programs. Such areas could include career exploration and outreach, articulation renewal, credit by examination, dual and concurrent enrollment and support for work-based learning and internships. \n\t\t \nFunding would approximate the results of merging Tech Prep funding into the base funding and calculating the split with California Department of Education. Using last year’s figures as a guide, CCCCO estimates approximately $43,000 per college to be put out as an allocation to consortia for fiscal year 2011-2012.  Although that sum is smaller than the historic Tech Prep allocation, the grant objectives would also be more circumscribed and focused on community college priorities. This action reduces the current allocation to the campus of $139,800 by $96,800, which will remove funding available for one Classified position. \n\t\t \nTherefore, the Chancellor recommends that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution No. 041211-6, Eliminate Positions and Layoff Classified Employees; and authorize District representatives to provide all affected employees with forty-five (45) day notices of layoff.\n\t\t \nIdentified is (1) position to eliminate, (1) employee who is to be laid off, and (1) employee who may be bumped due to the exercising of seniority rights.\n",
