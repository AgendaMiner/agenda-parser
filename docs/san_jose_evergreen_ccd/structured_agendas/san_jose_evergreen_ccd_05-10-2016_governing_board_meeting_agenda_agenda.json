In keeping with the District's desire to promote accountability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, the District went through a formal Request for Qualifications process to seek the services of a Program and Construction Management firm to provide system-wide coordination and oversight of all capital improvement work performed under the Measure G-2010 bond program.\u00a0 Gilbane Building Company was selected through this process.\n\t\u00a0\nSince the initial one-year contract with Gilbane, awarded by the Board on May 10, 2011, policies and procedures for operating under the Bond have been implemented, overall program and detailed project scheduling has been established and maintained, accounting and purchasing procedures have been put in place and numerous projects are either in design, construction, or have been completed and turned over to the colleges for occupancy. \u00a0Each contract was for time and materials only at a not-to-exceed amount, with the fifth year (FY2015/16) value of $5,297,131.\u00a0 The agreement has the option to renew annually through 2018.\u00a0 The proposed contract amount for the sixth year (FY2016/17) is valued at $6,087,934.\n\t\u00a0\nAs for the Measure G-2004 bond program, the FY2015/16 contract is $1,306,030 and the proposed FY2016/17 contract is $358,339.\n\t\u00a0\nThe Board is being asked to review this information on May 10, 2016 and then take action on a year six (FY2016/17) contract renewal for the Measure G-2010 bond program and a contract for FY2016/17 for the Measure G-2004 bond program at the June 14, 2016 Board of Trustees meeting.\n",
