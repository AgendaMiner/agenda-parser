Plescia & Co. and Gruen Gruen + Associates in completing tasks (through issuance of the Request for Proposals (RFP)) over and above the work items set forth in the original Scope of Work and to provide for the implementation of the RFP solicitation, including working with the City of San Jose on land use policy / entitlement issues.\n\t \nThe three primary reasons for the requested budget augmentation are as follows:\n\t \n1. Consultants attended and participated in a total number of meetings that substantially exceeded the number of meetings called for in the Scope of Work. The majority of these additional meetings related to: 1) meeting with private real estate brokers and developers as part of the predevelopment / due diligence process and 2) working with the Board of Trustee Land Sub-committee from July 2012 through March 2013.\n\t \nThe Scope of Work called for a total of thirteen (13) meetings for these tasks. To date A. Plescia & Co. and Gruen Gruen + Associates either individually or collectively have participated in twenty-one (21) meetings and/or telephone conference calls. This does not include future meetings to review/evaluate proposals submitted in response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) issued on May 17, 2013.\n\t \n2. The additional meetings with the Board of Trustee Land Sub-committee from July 2012 through March 2013 not only required the additional time for APC / GG+A to attend the subject meetings, but also required them to expend additional time associated with preparation and submittal of written information (agendas, analysis, memorandums / reports, etc.) requested by the Sub-committee members which was not included in the original Scope of Work.\n\t \n3. APC / GG+A incurred substantial additional time associated with the logistics of finalizing and distributing the Request for Proposals (RFP) document. As part of that process they established an RFP distribution list, prepared the appropriate cover letters for distribution of the RFP, distributed the RFP notice / cover letter to the RFP distribution list, and arranged with the Districtâs procurement staff loading of the RFP on the Districtâs web site. Again these were work items not included in the original Scope of Work.\n\t \nIn addition, in completing the RFP solicitation process it appears that additional effort will be necessary in working with the City of San Jose staff representatives regarding the relationship of City of San Jose land use policies on the type / extent of land use development envisioned for the 27-acre EVC development site.\n\t \n\t \n",

Thus, should the project be cancelled Blach could seek reimbursement for these trade subcontractor design phase expenses from the District as “work provided”.  However, if the project proceeds, the costs become part of the construction phase and are paid upon acceptance of the LLB Contractor Guaranteed Maximum Price.  This concept is normal in construction contracts where it is important to receive the benefit of specific trades during the design phase yet the intent is to continue the effort into the construction phase.  The project budget has anticipated these costs, which would be as follows:\nExterior Envelope (Royal Glass) - $646,356  (The scope of this effort is more extensive than other trades because it includes material mock ups, and complete detailed shop drawings and calculations that will expedite the Division of State Architect approval process.)\n \nHVAC/Mechanical Systems (AGC Mechanical) - $93,000\nPlumbing Systems (Hellwig Plumbing) - $42,000\nElectrical Systems (Rosendin Electric) - $76,000\n\t \nIn summary, the Board is asked to recognize that the award of design-assist trade contracts as listed above by the LLB Contractor commits them to subcontracts that, in the event of contract termination, would have the LLB Contractor seek compensation for costs up to the amount of $857,356 as part of its “work provided” under its contract terms.\n \n",
