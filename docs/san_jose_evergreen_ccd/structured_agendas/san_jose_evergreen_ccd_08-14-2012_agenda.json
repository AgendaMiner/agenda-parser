PG&E was immediately dispatched to assist with this problem. PG&E had informed the District that the cause was not linked to their services.\n\t \nThe District promptly contacted Cupertino Electric, Inc. to assist with this issue. On this same evening, Cupertino Electric, Inc. and the District shut down all disconnects throughout EVC so that PG&E could re-energize the buildings on the morning of Tuesday, June 12, 2012. After doing so, Feeders 1 and 4 were re-energized, bringing back online several buildings and structures, however the remaining buildings and structures failed to come back online. Staff that worked in these building were either redirected to other facilities and departments or requested to go home until further notice. In the meantime, Cupertino Electric, Inc. continued to troubleshoot over the next couple of days to pinpoint the fault in Feeders 2 and 3, testing 15,000 feet of cable.\n\t \nOn Thursday, June 14, 2012, Cupertino Electric, Inc. identified the damaged cable which was located between the portables and the center of the Cedro building. Cupertino Electric pulled over 600 feet of cable located 15 feet underground and uncovered a blown out cable. The cause of this blow out is unknown, however the cable was installed in 1983. The replacement cable was immediately placed on special order and delivered on Saturday, June 16, 2012. Cupertino Electric, Inc. then installed the new cable and conducted final tests to complete the distribution system. This was urgent because summer intersession was to start on Monday, June 18, 2012.\n\t \nTo avoid a possible precursor to failure, this work continued into Saturday, June 30, 2012 and Sunday, July 1, 2012, working on three EVC buildings: Acacia, Roble and Cedro. This work included, but was not limited to, replacing fiberglass sheets, which is used as insulation materials, tested and repaired an indoor substation due to a transformer having a low resistance, etc.\n\t \nThe District did not seek formal bids because this was an emergency that required immediate attention in order to secure the health and safety concern for our students, staff and faculty, as well as damage and danger to District property. Therefore, the District invoked California Public Contract Code Section 20654, which states, “In an emergency when any repairs, alterations, work or improvements is necessary to any facility of the college, or to permit the continuance of existing college classes, or to avoid danger to life or property, the board may by unanimous vote, with the approval of the county superintendent of schools … make a contract in writing or otherwise on behalf of the district for the performance of labor and furnishing of materials or supplies for the purpose without advertising for or inviting bids.” The District received approval from Mr. Kenneth Shelton, Chief Business Officer of Santa Clara County Office of Education, acting on behalf of Dr. Charles Weis, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools. \n\t \nTherefore, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees unanimously approve and award the contract to Cupertino Electric, Inc. in the amount of $149,784.91 for the emergency work due to the EVC power outage “without advertising for or inviting bids” “to avoid the danger of life and property.”\n",
