Under Section 5101, a bidder is entitled to relief from its bid due to a mistake if the awarding authority consents to allow the bidder to withdraw its bid.  Public contract Code 5103 further defines that a bidder may be relieved of its bid due to mistake when:  (a) A mistake was made.  (b) He or she gave the public entity written notice within five working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays, after the opening of the bids of the mistake, specifying in the notice in detail how the mistake occurred.  (c) The mistake made the bid materially different than he or she intended it to be. (d) The mistake was made in filling out the bid and not due to error in judgment or to carelessness in inspecting the site of the work, or in reading the plans or specifications.\n",
