These reports were submitted to the Board between May and June 2010. The reports included findings and recommendations that clarified the record with respect to many allegations and concerns. For ease of access a link to these reports follows:  \n \n\t \nhttp://www.sjeccd.edu/news/newsrelease/Pages/052110.aspx\n\t \n\t \nThe Board of Trustees and administration are taking the concerns very seriously by proposing and approving recommendations to strengthen oversight and accountability. Several proactive steps have already been taken to address the concerns raised in these reports.  The Board Policy Committee was formed in February 2010 and has held monthly meetings to review and strengthen certain policies, and the full Board of Trustees has already taken action in key policy areas.  District administration, similarly, has issued specific directives to District Office staff to strengthen existing administrative procedures and guidelines to ensure compliance.  \n\t \nIn particular, the Board directed the Chancellor to complete a systematic review of each of these three reports and to develop a management tool designed to address areas of concern, including a workplan with periodic reporting to the full Board on progress made.\n\t \nTo date several policies have been developed or revised and an analysis of all three reports has been completed.  This analysis yielded major thematic areas of focus to guide future work including oversight, compliance and accountability measures with respect to the Chancellor, trustees, and administration. The District Foundation is also reviewing all concerns raised and is working on revising its operational guidelines.  \n\t \n\t \nNext Steps\n\t \nA.  Prepare a Workplan designed to address the areas described above by implementing one or more of the actions described below: \nDevelop New Policies- in areas where no explicit policy is currently in place.\nRevise Existing Policies--in areas where policies are in place but need updating or strengthening.           \nDevelop New Procedures--in policy areas where explicit guidelines for implementation are not in place.  \nRevise Existing Procedures--in policy areas where current procedures need to be made clearer and more explicit.   \nB. Establish Compliance and Enforcement Staff Development Training --in areas where policies and procedures are clearly in place but uneven enforcement is found.  A proposed, systematic and periodic staff development process will be put in place to ensure uniform implementation and compliance with existing policies and procedures.\n\t \nC.  Establish a Periodic Reporting Calendar--to be presented to the Board of Trustees on the progress and implementation of the proposed workplan. \n",

It was enacted into law on August 17, 1988 on the approval of Public Law 100-402.\n\t \nSeptember 15 was chosen as the starting point for the celebration because it is the anniversary of independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. They all declared independence in 1821. In addition, Mexico and Chile celebrate their independence days on September 16 and September 18, respectively.\" [1] Public Law 100-402 authorizes and requests the President to issue an annual proclamation designating September 15 through October 15, as \"Hispanic Heritage Month.\"\n\t \nOctober 12, Columbus Day or Día de la Raza, also falls within this 30 day period.   \n",
