We intended for our students to come away from their study abroad experience seeing themselves as participants in a diverse and multicultural global society. \n",

Plescia & Co., Gruen Gruen + Associates, Eller & Associates and staff with the San Jose Evergreen Community College District (the âteamâ), have completed market research, real estate financial analysis, land use planning and policy review and obtained consensus from the Board of Trustees of the San Jose Evergreen Community District on guiding principles for the disposition and development of an approximately 27-acre site adjoining Evergreen Valley College identified as not needed for the operations of the College. The team conducted meetings with a sub-committee of the Board of Trustees formed in order to review alternative property disposition and entitlement approaches and to review and approve the solicitation materials and process. Meetings were also held with the full Board of Trustees, which approved the issuance of the Request for Proposals.  \n\t \nPre-proposal meetings were held with potential respondents. Four proposals were ultimately received. An initial report was prepared that described the proposed developments, business terms/conditions, present value of proposed ground rents, and advantages and disadvantages of each proposal. The team conducted discussions with the respondents and briefed the sub-committee on the evaluation of the proposals.\n\t \nAt the direction of the sub-committee, the team conducted meetings with the development teams regarding requested clarifying/additional information about their respective proposals. Based on the additional information, an updated proposal evaluation report was prepared and a closed session meeting with the full Board of Trustees was held on August 26th to discuss status of the land development project, respond to Trustee questions, and discuss next steps.  \n\t \nPURPOSE \n\t \nIn light of the policy direction, the purpose of the meeting on September 9, 2014 is to provide an update of the process to date, discuss any questions Trustees may have, and to describe the anticipated next steps to carry out the objectives of the disposition and development initiative to accomplish the goals of the Board of Trustees, including generating revenue to advance the educational mission of the District. \n",
