                    "item_details": "\nIn development of the 2025 Facilities Master Plan (FMP) for Evergreen Valley College (EVC), data related to the Evergreen Fault adjacent to campus was updated and depicted on the FMP site plan.  That data and plan identified portions of the EVC campus to be within a State-designated Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone.  California Geologic Survey Publication 42, “Fault Rupture Hazard Zones in California” requires designation of an area within 50 feet of an active fault as a no-build zone.  This requirement places the Roble and Acacia buildings at EVC within this no-build zone.\n\t \nFollowing this identification in November 2011, Evergreen Valley College considered various actions for the replacement or relocation of the affected buildings.  One consideration was to apply for state funding for both buildings, but there was no state funding for buildings and a state-wide bond would have been necessary to establish that funding.  This path, and the inability to commence design and construction until funding was identified, would have prevented EVC from taking any major action until at least 2015.  A second choice was to forego state funding completely and build complete replacement buildings under the Bond.  Under this scenario the new buildings would have been available for occupancy in early 2016, but would have depleted funds for other important aspects of the Facility Master Plan.  A third option was to address the Acacia Building and start its replacement buildings (South Campus and Automotive Technology) and to request state funding on replacing the Roble Building.  This would provide replacement for Acacia in 2016 and for Roble in 2018.  This third choice was the selected option, and funding requests for the Engineering/Applied Technology were submitted through an Initial Project Proposal (IPP) in July 2012 and a Final Project Proposal (FPP) in July 2013.  \n\t \nAt the same time, numerous actions were required of the District and the Board by the Education Code and Field Act as a result of the fault identification.  At its November 12, 2013 meeting the Board received information that updated the status of those required actions. (See attached presentation from that meeting.)  These included:\nPrepare cost estimates to address replacement or relocation of affected buildings – performed in June 2011 and Oct 2013\nNotify the State and apply for funding – notified in July 2012 and July 2013\nBoard notification – notified in November 2011 and November 2013\nEngineering study of building safety – completed by Thornton Tomasetti in October 2013\n\t \nThe key elements from that November 12, 2013 presentation were a finding that Roble and Acacia are, from an engineering standpoint, considered unsafe.  (The definition of “unsafe” is driven by Education Code 81162.)  Further, legal counsel has stated that, “The provisions of the Education Code … and the Field Act itself, do not require the District to stop using existing school buildings which have, by virtue of new information, been determined to be unsafe in the event of earthquake.”  And the engineers have noted that “There is no code or law in effect that mandates that buildings designed and constructed according to a previous version of the code need to be brought into conformance with the current code, provided that there is no change in use or alteration that includes a significant increase in load or decrease in structural capacity. So despite the fact that the Acacia and Roble Clusters do not meet current code, continued use of these buildings is allowed by code…..”\n\t \nSince the November 12, 2013 Board meeting, the college has presented the circumstances to the faculty and staff through participatory governance and campus forums, and to student government.  The engineer’s report, the schedules for retrofit and new building construction, and the opinions of legal counsel were all presented and discussed.  The various options were presented and additional options identified. At the conclusion of these meetings, with all considerations made, it is the consensus of the College and the President’s recommendation that Roble and Acacia remain in service without modification.  The South Campus and Automotive Technology projects will commence construction in 2014, which will provide replacement space for the majority of sections now using Acacia.  The college will continue pursuit of supportive State funding for the Engineering & Technology project, which will be constructed on the site of Roble.  Should State funding not materialize, the college will develop alternative plans to continue toward development of that building.\n\t \n\t \nAt the February 25, 2014 Board meeting the Board requested information regarding accessibility compliance of the buildings. While the condition of each building's accessibility is not specifically known as no recent studies have been performed, known ADA issues have been addressed by the College in previous years and elevators are in operation for floor-to-floor access.  The accessibility around the buildings has been evaluated through the site assessment and master planning recently accomplished and the College is undertaking efforts to address those findings.  \n\t \nAdditionally information was requested on February 25, 2014 regarding which planned projects might be affected by use of funds to strengthen both buildings (Option 2).  Should the strengthening of Roble and Acacia be directed, funding will be drawn from the college's Measure G-2010 funds currently designated for building demolition and from various other projects that are focused on 1) addressing mechanical and electrical deficiencies on campus, 2) providing students new classroom furniture and 3) addressing interior and exterior environmental conditions across the campus.\n",
