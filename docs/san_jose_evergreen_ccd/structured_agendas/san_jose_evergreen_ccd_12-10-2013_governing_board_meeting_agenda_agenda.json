The Chancellor’s Office retains the authority to review district plans on a case-by-case basis.  Each district shall review its EEO Plan at least once every three years and revise as determined necessary.  Any revised EEO Plan shall be submitted to the Chancellor’s Office, which retains the authority to review such revisions on a case-by-case basis.  \n\t \nTitle 5, Section 53024.1 requires each district to develop and maintain institutional commitment to diversity.  Establishing and maintaining a richly diverse workforce is an on-going process that requires continued institutionalized effort. Districts shall locally develop, and implement on a continuing basis, indicators of institutional commitment to diversity. \n\t \nThe San José-Evergreen Community College District’s Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity Advisory Committee has devoted countless number of hours to the development of this EEO & Diversity Plan over the past few years.  Acknowledgement and appreciation for these special efforts go to all who have been instrumental in providing support for the development of this Plan, and in particular to the District EEO & Diversity Advisory Committee members who were appointed by their constituency groups, including:  Barbara Hanfling (Faculty Association), Clem Lundie (SJCC Academic Senate), Marjorie Clark (EVC Academic Senate – until summer 2013), Adrienne Burns (EVC CSEA), Joe Lugo, Jr. (SJCC CSEA), Vince Oen* (DO CSEA), Charles Stevens (SJCC Associated Student Government), Dr. Elaine Burns (MSC SJCC), Sam Ho (Co-Chair/MSC DO – Chancellor-appointed), Victoria Lugo* (MSC EVC), and Arturo Ocampo* (Co-Chair/MSC DO – Chancellor-appointed).  (*Those who are denoted with asterisks have left District’s employment).  The drafts of the Plan were distributed to District Council on 12.20.2012 (narrative), 4.18.2013 (attachments), 10.17.2013, and 11.21.2013.  At the 11.21.2013 meeting, District Council approved the Plan Draft.  The Plan Draft was submitted for Board of Trustees' first reading at the 11.26.2013 meeting.    \n\t \nThe San José-Evergreen Community College District’s Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity Advisory Committee would like to express appreciation to the Chancellor, the Chancellor’s Executive Team, the District Council representing Constituency Groups for Faculty, Classified, Management/Supervisory/Confidential, and Students for your time and efforts in the review, recommendation, and support for this EEO & Diversity Plan. \n\t \nThe San José-Evergreen Community College District’s Equal Employment Opportunity & Diversity Advisory Committee would like to also thank Chancellor Dr. Rita Cepeda for her leadership and guidance in the development of this Plan, and for presenting this Plan to the Board of Trustees.\n\t \nAttached is the final draft of the EEO & Diversity Plan, incorporating Board's recommendation at the November 26, 2013 meeting to include the narrative for adjunct faculty demographics, for Board adoption at the December 10, 2013 meeting.\n\t \n\t \n",
