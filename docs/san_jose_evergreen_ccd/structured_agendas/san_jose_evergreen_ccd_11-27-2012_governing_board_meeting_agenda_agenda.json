Among vendors who chose to self-identify, there was a 163% increase in expenditure from FY 2010-2011. This increase has resulted in a 22% growth of small business expenditures from FY 2010-2011.

Gilbane’s Program Coordinator performs a key role by providing outreach, training and educational programs in regards to Measure G 2010 projects.
