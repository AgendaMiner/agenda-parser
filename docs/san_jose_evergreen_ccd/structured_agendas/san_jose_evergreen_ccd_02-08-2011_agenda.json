Listed below is a list of individuals recommended for appointment to the Measure G-2004/Measure G-2010 Citizens’ Oversight Committee commencing February 9, 2011. The Board of Trustees will be provided with a follow-up recommendation when additional candidates are identified.\n \n        \nRepresenting                       Appointee                       Term Expires    \nCommunity At-Large          Joseph Becker                February 8, 2013\nCommunity At-Large          Daniel Kojiro                   February 8, 2013\nCommunity At-Large          Spencer Horowitz          February 8, 2013\nCommunity At-Large          Carol Lizak                       February 8, 2013\nCommunity At-Large          Ann Mancuso Engdahl  February 8, 2013\nTaxpayers’ Association       Jimmy Nguyen               February 8, 2013\nStudent Representative     Raymond Porras            February 8, 2013\nStudent Representative     Linda Lam                       February 8, 2013\n \n\t \n\t \n \n",
