presentation on the conceptual costs of building a new facility at EVC and for the purchase and renovation of an off-campus facility.\n\t \nMonthly Measure G-2010 Summary Report through June 30, 2012 \nAttached please find the Measure G-2010 Summary Report through June 30, 2012\n\t \nAPPROVE AS ACTION ITEMS \nContracts\nApproval to Utilize Lease/Leaseback Delivery Method\nAt the Board meetings held March 13, 2012 and June 12, 2012, the Board was presented information and details by the Program Management team and District legal counsel on the Lease/Leaseback project delivery method.  The Board is asked to approve this method for two Measure G-2010 projects – San Jose City College Theater & Vocational Technology project and the EVC South Campus Development project.\n\t \nMaster Agreement and Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) – Anderson Brule Architects - SJCC Phase 1 Painting Project Design Services\nIn response to a Request for Qualifications for Professional Architectural Services, five design professional firms were selected to provide design services via a Master Agreement as may be requested related to Measure G-2010 projects.  Anderson Brule Architects, a woman-owned small business, is one of the five firms.  Following on that award, San Jose City College requested a proposal from Anderson Brule Architects to evaluate and develop design services to address various painting needs of the campus.  The response was evaluated by the College and based on that review Anderson Brule Architects was selected to provide the services.  The Board is asked to approve issuance of a Master Agreement and PAA to Anderson Brule Architects in the amount of $36,000 for Phase 1 Painting Design Services at SJCC.\n\t \nStandard Form of Agreement (Design Professional Services) – Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects – SJCC Performing Arts Center & Vocational Technology Building\n\t \nIn keeping with the updated Facilities Master Plan for SJCC approved by the Board on November 29, 2011, a Request for Qualifications and Proposal for Professional Design Services was issued for the Performing Arts Center and Vocational Technology Building at SJCC.\n\t \nAs a result of the received responses and interviews with short-listed firms, the College selected the firm of Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects, a woman-owned firm, for professional design services.  The Board is asked to approve the award of programming design services for the San Jose City College Performing Arts Center & Vocational Technology Building to Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects in the amount of $201,777.\n\t \n\t \nProfessional Service and Construction Change Orders \nProfessional Service Change Order to Allana Buick and Bers Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) EVC-01 –– EVC Gullo Student Services Center\nThe Gullo Student Services Center at EVC has experienced roof and wall leaks for many years.  The leaks have caused interior damage and pose potential risk to equipment.  The Board approved issuance of a Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) to Allana Buick and Bers (ABB) at its May 8, 2012 Board meeting to provide a condition assessment and design services related to the issues with the building’s roof.  As a result of the condition assessment it was found that the building’s exterior wall was in need of repair as well.\n\t \nABB was selected in competition with two other firms because of its expertise in building exterior envelope investigation.  Based on that expertise, its current knowledge of Gullo and the desire to have the roof and wall repairs made during the summer of 2013 (during minimal College activity), the Board is requested to approve a revision to the original PAA that broadens the scope of services by ABB to include detailed assessment of the building exterior wall and provide design services to repair or replace the exterior wall of the Gullo Student Services Center at EVC.\n\t \nProfessional Service Change Order to Aedis Architecture & Planning Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) EVC-01– EVC Central Energy Plant & Police Renovation\nOn January 10, 2012 the Board approved a Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) to Aedis to provide design professional services for the EVC Central Energy Plant (CEP) & Police Renovation.  As the design has completed the program phase, it is necessary at this time to revise the PAA to reflect the approved project program documents by 1) adjusting the identified project construction cost to $10,216,979 (as identified in Bond List Revision #2 approved by the Board on May 8, 2012), and 2) increasing the PAA amount by $18,118 to align with the adjusted project construction cost, and 3) modifying the PAA Schedule of Values to reflect the increased PAA amount and 4) making minor changes to the terms of the PAA that more accurately reflect project parameters.  The Board is asked to approve Change Order #1 to the Aedis PAA EVC-01 per the above.\n\t \nProfessional Service Change Order to Aedis Architecture & Planning Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) EVC-02 – Police Station Interim Housing and Measure G-2010 Offices\nOn May 8, 2012 the Board approved a Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) to Aedis to provide design professional services for interim Police operations during renovation and remodel of the Police station at EVC and for housing program/construction management staff related to Measure G-2010.  A revision to that PAA is necessary to 1) reflect the current planning that consolidates these temporary buildings onto one site on the EVC campus and 2) reflect the necessity that all these buildings be reviewed and approved by DSA, and 3) increase the amount of the PAA by $15,895 to accommodate the additional design services and contract administration required of the design professional for DSA projects.  The Board is asked to approve a no-cost Change Order #1 to the Aedis PAA EVC-02 for the Police Station Interim Housing and Measure G-2010 Offices to accurately reflect revised project parameters as noted above.\n\t \nProfessional Service Change Order to HMC Architecture Project Assignment Amendment (PAA) EVC-01 – South Campus Programming\nOn April 10, 2012 the Board approved a PAA to HMC Architecture for the initial programming of the Science and Mathematics Building at EVC.  Based on that effort, which is now complete, the College developed what is now called the “South Campus Development” which consolidates the design and construction work of the proposed Fitness Center, Social Science Classroom Building and the Science and Mathematics Building into one project. It is necessary at this time to proceed into detailed building programming for this project.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve the issuance of a Professional Service Change Order to HMC Architecture for detailed building programming design services at EVC for the South Campus Development project in the amount of $87,600.\n\t \n\t \nBond List Revisions \nNone\n\t \n\t \n",
