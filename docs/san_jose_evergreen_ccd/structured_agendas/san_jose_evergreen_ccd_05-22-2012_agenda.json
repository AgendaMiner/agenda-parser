                    "item_details": "\nIn October 2010, a team representing the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of San Jose City College and Evergreen Valley College (EVC). The evaluation recommended, in part, (EVC 2004 Shared Recommendation 12) that the colleges should integrate the objectives of their technology plans into a District Technology Master Plan. Additionally, the evaluation determined, in part, (2010 Shared District Recommendation 1) that \"the district, in collaboration with San Jose City College and Evergreen Valley College, should develop and implement a plan that will provide the necessary resources to increase college and district research capacity to analyze progress toward achieving institutional goals and objectives including improvements in student achievement and student learning.\"\n\t \nIn November 2010, the voters approved Measure G - 2010, to provide $268 million to support the District's efforts toward upgrading its facilities and technology. Of this $268 million, $30 million is currently budgeted for technology upgrades.\n\t \nIn order to respond to the ACCJC, to ensure that the District is maximizing the general obligation bond dollars allocated toward technology upgrades, and to continue its pursuit of institutional efficiencies, the District commissioned an assessment of its information technology support services in October 2011. The results of the assessment (attached) found the following: \n\t \nSeasoned and experienced community college technology leadership is not present in the District.\nTechnology governance is not formalized.\nThroughout the District, staff members are dedicated and hard-working.\nSignificant technology investments have not yielded expected results.\nIn user offices and in the technology area, a lack of consistency and standards prevents the District from achieving desired results.\nTechnology planning is not in evidence. As a result, the ability to leverage implementation decisions in order to appropriately scaffold results is impossible.\nStudents, faculty, and staff are underserved by the current state of the Datatel implementation.\nThe Datatel implementation has problems that require significant attention. Changing systems will not solve the underlying issues. In most cases, the functionality of Datatel is adequate.\nData-driven decision making is challenged by the lack of a well-crafted reporting architecture.\n\t \nIn order for the District to transform its information technology support services into a pragmatic, results-oriented, service-focused, and stewardship-driven organization, the District issued a solicitation in March 2012 (attached) with the intent of engaging professional subject-matter experts to assist the District in meeting its technology needs. The scope of service included in the solicitation was:\n\t \nDevelop and implement a best practice technology support model that ensures the appropriate deployment of all technology support. Provide day-to-day management oversight to the District Technology operations.\nDevelop and implement a long-term District Technology Plan aligned with the District's strategic objectives and operational needs based upon the District's Strategic Direction, Educational Master Plan, and Facilities Master Plan, including strategic, tactical, disaster recovery, business continuity, and information and data security plans.\nMaximize the Datatel Colleague administrative system. Develop and implement policies, procedures, and training related to Datatel use. Assess, analyze, and bring online, as appropriate, unused or underutilized modules. Develop and implement a comprehensive business review process.\nManage and implement the District's technology projects funded by the District's Proposition 39 General Obligation Bonds (Measure G - 2010).\nImprove the District's web presence.\nDevelop and implement a student email system that incorporates tools for collaboration.\nDevelop and implement a District intranet.\nImprove online service delivery.\nDevelop and implement a network security plan.\nComplete a system inventory and associated life cycle replacement plan and budget.\nReview all technology-related contracts to identify potential cost savings as well as to identify vulnerabilities.\nAttendance at, and assistance with meetings with the Board of Trustees, District Executive Team, Technology Leadership Group, vendors, and District staff.\nWork collaboratively with other consultants and District staff. \n\t \nThe solicitation was sent to seven (7) potential vendors identified by surveying other bay area community colleges and from vendors currently on the District's list of potential vendors and placed in the legal advertisement section of the San Jose Post Record for two weeks. Of seven (7) potential vendors, two (2) submitted bids to the District and one (1) submitted a \"no bid.\" The respondents were CampusWorks and Strata Information Group, Inc. (SIG).\n\t \nThe two (2) bids were evaluated by a committee that included the Director of Fiscal Services, the Vice Chancellor of Human Resources, the Vice President of Administrative Services at EVC, the Executive Director of Research and Institutional Effectiveness, the District's IT Applications Manager, a FA Representative, a CSEA Representative, and a Purchasing Agent. Both vendors were selected to provide a presentation to the committee based upon the following criteria: Capacity to Perform (40%), Pricing (35%), References (20%), and Local and Small Business Preference (5%). \n\t \nCampusWorks was selected to be recommended for award after negotiating the price down to $483,600 annually plus expenses set at 7% ($33,852) for a total annual price of $517,452. (The bid is attached for reference.) Additionally, CampusWorks has included an incentive-based fee structure. Under the arrangement, 10% of the contract cost will be set aside and released quarterly upon mutual agreement of the satisfactory completion of project milestones. The funding source for this endeavor is from the General Fund and Measure G - 2010, as appropriate. Furthermore, it is believed that the District will realize savings generated by a thorough review and re-negotiation of technology contracts, and savings attributable to better planning and management.\n\t \n\t \n  \n",

The presentation included a discussion on the relative costs associated with the three options, which included renovation of the existing District Office facility, construction of a new office facility on District owned property, and the purchase and renovation of an existing off-campus facility. Due to favorable market conditions and the high cost of new construction, the most economic option is to purchase an existing off-campus facility and renovate it to suit the needs of the District Office.\n\t \nComments received from the Board on May 8th included several site selection criteria and a general concern about moving the District Office off-campus. The list of site criteria that the District Office Project Team will be considering to evaluate prospective properties will include:\nLocation \nPrice \nSize \nTransportation proximity and accessibility\nParking amenities\nQuality of structure and tenant improvements\nLayout (single or multi-story)\nVisibility of structure\nSignage availability\nBoard Room accommodations\nThe Project Team also determined there are a total of seventy one (71) California Community College Districts. Twenty-two (22) of those are multi-college districts and twelve (12) of the multi-college districts are served by off-campus district offices.   \n\t \nRECOMMENDATION\nThe most economical solution points to relocation of the District Office to an off-campus facility. This option also appears to be the only option achievable within the current budget allocated to this project and results in the existing parcel being made available for development, allowing the District to realize an additional revenue generating potential of $450K to $700K annually, depending on the approved use of the parcel. \n\t \nIt is recommended that the Board of Trustees authorize staff to proceed with a search for new off-campus facilities to house District operations.\n\t \nPATH FORWARD\nIf authorization is granted to initiate the search for a new off-campus District Office facility, qualified candidate facilities will be identified and studied to determine the cost of adapting them to suit the District’s operational needs. Those meeting the District’s requirements will be presented to the Chancellor for consideration. Once a facility has been vetted by the Project Team and approved by the Chancellor, it will be presented to the Board for consideration.\n",

Included in this framework was the recommendation that the District utilize a program and construction management firm to provide program and construction management services to the colleges and District to support implementation of various construction and deferred maintenance projects. In keeping with the District's desire to promote accountability, efficiency and cost effectiveness, the District went through a formal Request for Qualifications process to seek the services of a Program and Construction Management firm to provide system-wide coordination and oversight of all capital improvement work performed under the Measure G-2010 bond program.  Gilbane Building Company was selected through this process.\n\t \nThe initial one-year contract with Gilbane Building Company included program mobilization, scheduling, strategic program planning for implementation and design, and general program support at the campuses and the District. The first year contract was for time and materials only at a not-to-exceed amount of $2,166,832 with the option to renew the agreement annually through 2018.  The Board of Trustees approved the contract at the May 10, 2011 Board of Trustees meeting.\n\t \nThe Board is being asked to review this information on May 22, 2012 and then take action on a year two (FY2012/13) contract renewal at the June 12, 2012 Board of Trustees meeting.\n\t \n",
