He reviewed the 1 Person 1 Vote Rule, principles of the Voting Rights Act and those portions of the Education Code requiring that all school districts redraw their trustee areas after the federal census. Dr. Griffin also introduced the principle of 1% variance between and among contiguous trustee areas.  In other words, that we draw district boundaries that distribute the population in our service area within 1% of each other.  \n\t \nFollowing the presentation and after some discussion the board provided the following direction for the subsequent steps in the process:\n\t \nReview principles established by the Board of Trustees during the last redistricting effort in 2001 and integrate these same principles in the proposed options to be brought back to the Board (the overarching concern here is not to disadvantage minority communities and to support the election of a diverse board)\nGPS maps of proposed options should include major traffic arteries to make it easier to determine when a trustee area begins and ends and to compare and contrast with the current boundaries.\nPresent clear timelines between the next presentation (first formal public hearing) and the end of the process\nIdentify outreach efforts to inform district constituents (voters) of the process underway at SJECCD and opportunities for public input.\n\t \n\t \nAttachments\n\t \nPrinciples (based on a review of past board discussions and current model practices) \nWeb link to the Draft of Current Options \nRedistricting Timelines\nSummary of outreach efforts and request for Board Input\n",
