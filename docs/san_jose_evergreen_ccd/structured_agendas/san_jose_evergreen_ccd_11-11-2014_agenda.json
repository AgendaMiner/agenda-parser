Originally started in 1987, FIL now hosts over 1,600 publishers from over 39 different countries. It is the largest gathering of Spanish-language books, with approximately 20,000 professionals in attendance, as well as 750,000 members of the general public.  In addition to workshops, there will be literary agents and scouts, distributors, and booksellers that will share information about the materials.  The American Library Association (ALA) calls the event the most important exhibit of Spanish-language books in the world.  \n\t \nFIL provides a significant cultural bridge between U.S. regions and other Spanish-language areas of the world that share the desire to have materials in Spanish.  Professor Villarreal teaches Chicano and Latino Culture, and attendance at FIL will enhance his knowledge and teaching.  Furthermore, Professor Villarreal oversees the purchase of books and media for the Evergreen Valley College through the Cambios Title V program.  Many librarians from the U.S. and other countries come to secure information pertinent to their situations as there is more and more demand for books in the Spanish-language at all levels, and FIL offers a chance to see these up close.  \n\t \nProfessor Villarreal will receive $500 in Staff Development Funds to apply toward expenses incurred for this event.\n\t \n",

Overaa & Company provided construction cost estimates based on those documents.  These estimates indicated the project was over budget. The College, Architect, Contractor and Gilbane evaluated the project scope and identified approximately $500,000 in scope reductions and designated another $300,000 in bid alternates.  Based on this analysis, the anticipated construction cost was approximately $9,900,000.\n\t \nDSA approved the project in late August 2014.  C. Overaa & Company then put the project out for subcontractor bidding.  Based on the bids received, C. Overaa & Company has presented a GMP of $11,347,704.  The College, Architect, Contractor and Gilbane reviewed the GMP in detail and identified certain items that affected bid prices, most notably market factors such as significant increases in material costs and a very high local construction demand.  The scope had also been increased to support technology and security infrastructures, and instructional fixtures and equipment, that were not included in the original budget.  The project team once again embarked on a significant effort to identify scope modifications that would not impact program quality.  Efforts will continue throughout the course of construction to identify potential cost savings to the project.  \n\t \nThe original budgeted construction value of the project was $9,430,000. The Board of Trustees approved (at the October 28, 2014 meeting) Bond List Revision No. 11 which added $3.3 million to this project in order to cover these additional costs.   \n\t \nPlease note that while this is a “guaranteed” maximum price, the GMP is subject to adjustments for extra work and changes as directed by the District. Upon execution of the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease, C. Overaa & Company will be granted access to and control of the site to commence construction.  Substantial Completion of the construction will be achieved within (365) calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.\n",
