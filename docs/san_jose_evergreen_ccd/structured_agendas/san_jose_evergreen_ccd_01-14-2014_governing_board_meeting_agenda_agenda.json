Mancini, were to provide the building’s exterior envelope.\n\t \nAt the completion of the Design Development phase the project was estimated to be approximately $6.5 million over budget.  After extensive effort to bring the project within budget by the entire project team and the College, one major element, the exterior envelope, was identified as carrying significant costs and contingencies because of its design.  To address this the exterior envelope configuration was simplified, and while the involvement of Royal and Mancini was critical to identifying the problem and developing alternative solutions, the normalizing of the exterior design eliminates the need for further special exterior envelope design assistance.  Additionally it is anticipated that the simpler design will make the project more attractive to a broader subcontractor base and provide stronger bids for the work.  It is for these reasons that the project team recommends directing termination of the design-assist contracts for Royal Glass and B.T. Mancini.\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve a Change Order to Blach’s Preconstruction Agreement in the amount of $102,254 to compensate the exterior envelope design-assist subcontractors for the cost of services they provided to substantiate estimates, initiate shop drawings and eventually help scale back the design to meet the budget.  Their detailed timesheets and work product have been reviewed by Gilbane, Blach and HMC Architects.  After negotiation the final presented costs are found reasonable for the duration and effort of those subcontracts.  The change order amount includes a 5% mark-up for Blach Construction as detailed in their contract for procurement and coordination efforts with these subcontractors.  (Please note that this approach has been reviewed with legal counsel, and it is their opinion that the Blach Preconstruction Agreement is a professional services agreement, and as such is not subject to the statutory limitations of the Public Contract Code.)\n",

The training was provided by Miriam Carver, Carver Consulting. Ms. Carver provided an overview of the principles of board governance and leadership, differentiation between the roles of the college board and the chief executive officer, the board's accountability to their \"constituents, \" (defined as the  840,000  voters in the seven trustee district service areas,)  evaluation of the chief executive officer and the board itself, how to maintain board discipline, differentiation between policy and management, and many other such relevant topics.\nAfter the training, the board discussed its desire to use the Carver Policy Governance Model as its approach for providing governance and leadership for the district and the need to declare their intent at their next meeting; including a discussion of the preparatory steps leading to the adoption of the model.\n\t \nAs part of the next steps process for moving forward with the Carver Policy Governance Model, then Board President Mayra Cruz introduced the concept at both colleges during the August 29, 2013, PDD. President Cruz informed district members that they would receive training on this model, which would be scheduled at a future date before the end of the calendar year. At the September 10, 2013, governing board meeting, the Board took action to initiate a process to explore the adoption of the Carver Policy Governance Model. Therefore, President Cruz requested that Chancellor Cepeda move forward with the next steps in providing further training for the board and district members. Chancellor Cepeda provided information on the model to the district's constituency group leaders at the September 16, 2013, District Council meeting. At that meeting, DVD's of the Carver Policy Governance Model were provided to constituency groups so that they could share this information with their respective constituencies during their regularly scheduled group meetings. Further information and training was provided for constituency group leaders by Ms. Carver on December 9, 2013, and December 12, 2013, at the District Office. The Board itself received training on the development of policies using the Carver Policy Governance Model at its regularly scheduled meeting on December 10, 2013, and at two special governing board meetings held on December 11 and December 13, 2013. After the special meeting held on December 13, the majority of the board expressed interest in moving forward with adopting the Carver Policy Governance Model.\n\t \nIt is, therefore, recommended that the Board of Trustees sunshine their expectation to adopt the Carver Policy Governance Model as its model of governance and leadership.\n\t \n",
