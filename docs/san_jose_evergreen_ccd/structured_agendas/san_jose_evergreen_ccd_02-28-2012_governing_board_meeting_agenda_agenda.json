Target to Funded Cap \nMaximize fall/spring course offerings – reduce summer school program* – reduce intersession.\nAnticipate 5.56% potential FTES reduction if State Tax Measure Fails (Nov. 2012).\nEstablish fixed Adjunct Faculty Budgets based on defined productivity ratios-unit allocation system.\nReduce General Fund Support for “Restricted Programs”\nReduce/Eliminate Fund 10 backfill for Categorical Programs\nRaise Parking Fees for Fall and Spring from $40 up to $50 and from $8 up to $25 for summer.*\nApply parking permit fees and/or daily parking fees to staff (requires collective bargaining).\nIncrease daily parking fees from $2 to $3.\nDefund Position Vacancies\nEliminate budgets and realize savings for vacant positions, retirements, resignations and reorganizations.** \nMaximize Use of Other Funds\nBookstore Fund Balance transfer (one-time dollars).\nWorkforce Institute Fund Balance support (one-time dollars).\nCharge direct staff costs to grants, categoricals, auxiliary, and/or bond funds, as appropriate.\nMaximize indirect cost allowance associated with grants.\nCollective Bargaining\nContractual items will be negotiated with respective labor representatives as appropriate.  These strategies may include the work calendar, compensation; benefit restructuring and other areas identified through the bargaining process.\n \n*time sensitive item – the timeline for preparing the summer schedule begins in March; in addition, early warning to students about the summer session will enable them to plan appropriately.\n \n**Given significant reductions in existing staff undertaken last year, it is clear that the District cannot undertake “reduction in force” as a primary strategy.  The preferred approach is not to fill current vacancies for the 2012-2013 budget year, and to subsequently revisit this matter.\n\t \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n",

Subsequent to this review, Dr. Barbara Beno, communicated the results of the Commission deliberations through letters addressed to Presidents Kavalier and Yong and to Chancellor Cepeda (see attached).   Both presidents have issued messages to their college constituents summarizing the findings and identifying the next steps in the process.  Copies of the three letters are attached to this item.\n\t \nAs we anticipated, the Commission elected to maintain current status for both colleges, acting to “continue Evergreen Valley College on Warning and San Jose City College on Probation and to require Follow-Up Reports from both colleges by October 15, 2012.”  And while this is a bit disheartening here is the good news:\n\t \nWe avoided a further decline to the next level of sanction (i.e. “show cause” for City and “probation” for EVC.)  This action was certainly an option for the Commission had they determined that little or no efforts had been undertaken to address their concerns.  The opposite was true; in fact, Dr. Beno stated that:\n\t \n “While acknowledging the significant work that has been accomplished by both colleges and the District to begin to address recommendations and resolve deficiencies, the Commission has chosen to wait until all work is completed and deficiencies resolved, before taking action to remove sanctions.” \n\t \nIn addition, as the letters indicate many of the concerns have been removed from consideration and a reduced but critical list is now in place.  The Commission expects us to address fully the remaining recommendations in advance of their next visit, which is now scheduled for October 2012. It is important to note that addressing these recommendations is now the number one priority of our colleges and our entire district. \n\t \nThis item will provide a summary of the remaining recommendations for San Jose City College and Evergreen Valley College, in addition to three remaining \"Shared\" or districtwide recommendations.\n\t \n",
