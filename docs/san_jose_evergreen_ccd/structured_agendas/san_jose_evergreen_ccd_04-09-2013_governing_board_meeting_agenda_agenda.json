SJECCD does not have a consolidated set of design standards.  An effort in early 2011 was made to identify the prevalent materials used on each campus, but that information needs to be developed further to be useful in ensuring that certain minimum standards are met in the design and construction of future projects.\n\t \nOn October 9, 2012 the Board approved an ICA to HMC Architects (HMC) in the amount of $245,000 for professional services to prepare District Design Standards.  These Design Standards will be used for all future projects District-wide and will be germane to each campus as applicable.  At the time the ICA was issued, it did not include standards for Information Technology as this portion of the scope was anticipated to be managed separately. The District has since determined that, due to time constraints and in the interest of economy, the Information Technology Standards should be developed in concert with the development of the balance of the design standards by HMC Architects. HMC was requested to prepare a proposal to add this effort to their scope.  Based on the proposal received and negotiated, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Revision #01 to the ICA with HMC to prepare design standards for Information Technology, and to extend the schedule for deliverables to accommodate the additional scope of work to June 30, 2014.  \n                                               \nHMC Architects ICA contract value          $245,000\nHMC Architects ICA revision 001             $  22,900\n\t \nRevised contract total                               $267,900\n\t \n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve Revision #001 to the ICA with HMC ARCHITECTS  for professional services to establish Information Technology Standards as part of the District Design Standards in the amount of $22,900 and to extend the term of the ICA to June 30, 2014.\n",

The Board approved a contract with Lionakis on May 08, 2012 to provide design and construction administration services for the EVC Automotive Technology project.  At that time the college understood that an appropriate Automotive Technology facility might require more funding than had been originally allocated for construction and agreed to defer any adjustments to the budget until a final program for the facility was completed and approved. Thus the original Lionakis contract includes a fixed price for programming and a percentage fee for design based on the original conceptual construction budget of $5.7M. The final College approved program indicated a probable cost of construction of $8,842,798. Based on this, the project budget, and bond list, was revised and approved by the Board on December 11, 2012. This adjustment to project scope and budget warrants a corresponding adjustment to the design agreement with Lionakis in accordance with the contract terms, in the amount of $259,281.\n\t \nIn addition, the original contract provided for analysis of sustainable strategies (supporting LEED Silver certification) for the project through programming.  With the programming complete and the sustainable strategies identified, the design effort necessary to design and certify specific components into the project needs to be added.  This component of the Lionakis proposal, reviewed by the college and Gilbane, is valued at an additional $61,534.\n\t \nLionakis PAA EVC-01Contract Value  $668,350\nLionakis design services based on revised construction cost  ADD $259,281\nLionakis services for LEED Silver design and certification  ADD $61,534\nTotal revised Lionakis contract value $989,165\n\t \nThe Board is asked to approve issuance of Revision #001 to LIONAKIS PAA EVC-01 increasing the cost of design and construction phase services on the EVC Automotive Technology Project in the amount of $320,815.\n",
