Measure G-2010 was passed by the voters on November 2, 2010, after which the Board of Trustees took action on December 14, 2010 to amend and restate the bylaws to allow for the existing committee to support both Measure G-2004 and Measure G-2010.\n\t \nThe Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) is required by statute to meet at least annually to review the District’s Measure G-2004/Measure G-2010 bond projects plan and to ensure that bond funds are being appropriately used as authorized by the voters.  There are no penalties defined in law for failure to convene a citizens’ oversight committee; however, the spirit of the law contemplates that districts will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the committee functions at least once each year to fulfill its statutory duties.  The current CBOC convenes quarterly for meetings.\n\t \nPursuant to Proposition 39, the Measure G-2004/Measure G-2010 Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is required to have a minimum of seven (7) members comprised of one (1) student active in a community college support group, such as student government, on the Committee and per the request of the District there be a minimum of one (1) Student representative per College, two (2) Community-At-Large members, one (1) Senior Citizens’ Organization member, one (1) Business Community member and one (1) Support Organization member. It is requested that the following applicants be appointed to the Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee by the Board of Trustees to fill the current vacancies. \n\t \nMember            Representing\nAlex Ward         Student, San Jose City College                \nJohnny Lee        Community-At-Large\n\t \nIt is also requested that the Board of Trustees approves the request for current Community-At-Large member, Joseph Becker, to change affiliations for which he is representing on the Committee in order to fill the vacant seat of Senior Citizens’ Organization.\n",
