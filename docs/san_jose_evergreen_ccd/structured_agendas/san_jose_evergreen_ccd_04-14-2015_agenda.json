This agreement enabled the District to obtain the highest value for every dollar spent on technology equipment through August 31, 2014.\n\t \nOn August 26, 2014 (Board Item F-11), the Board of Trustees authorized the extension of the WSCA/NASPO Contract Administration approved Master Price Agreement B27160 Amendment Number 3, determining that it was in the best interest of the District to continue to 'piggyback' on the contract between WSCA/NASPO and Dell Marketing, LLP as the single source supplier of the District's technology equipment.

This agreement enabled the District to obtain the highest value for every dollar spent on technology equipment through March 31, 2015.\n\t \nOn March 10, 2015, WSCA/NASPO Contract Administration approved Master Price Agreement B27160 Amendment Number 5, to extend the expiration date to September 30, 2015. Therefore, when considering the best interest of the District, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the extension of a piggybackable contract between WSCA/NASPO and Dell Marketing, LLP without the need to further advertise for bids on an already competitively bid contract. Attached are an affidavit of publication, an approval of award recommendation dated April 10, 2009 and the WSCA/NASPO Master Price Agreement B27160 Amendment Number 5.\n",
